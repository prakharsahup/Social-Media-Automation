1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,439
Mr. Malia is out of the

2
00:00:02,439 --> 00:00:05,839
country. Sicker Baron Vijay Malia who

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,120
find himself in a raging 9,000 cr loan

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,840
default scam. Welcome on figuring out

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,000
sir. Why are you doing this after 9? In

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,640
India public opinion is very quickly

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,760
formed and influenced by the media

8
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:25,800
pasa loot. Hi, I'm Vijay

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,279
Malian. So it's not just huge, it is and

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,760
nothing else comes close. King Fisher is

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,360
a class apart. VJ Mallay is

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,200
you were the biggest airline in the

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,879
country. Welcome aboard King Fisher

14
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,040
Airlines India's biggest airline going

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,800
to be there amongst the best airlines in

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,920
the world. What went wrong? So I went to

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,399
Shri Pranabokuji then finance minister

18
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,960
of India. I have to downsize this aine.

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,000
I was told not to downsize King Fisher

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,640
at that time. You continue, banks will

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,600
support you. That is how it all started.

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,680
Kingfisher Airlines has been forced to

23
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,799
suspend all of its flights.

24
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,960
Kingfisher Airlines has been struggling.

25
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,880
At the time when you asked loan, the

26
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,479
company was not doing that great. Please

27
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,320
never forget I gave my personal

28
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,119
guarantee. So all this narrative of

29
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:21,280
chore people give you this kind of loan

30
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,439
against collateral. They took shares of

31
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,080
King Visha Airlines at the double

32
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,439
price. There's again a statement that

33
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,720
your international employees were

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,560
getting paid. Indian employees were not.

35
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,479
The company in India had no money. It

36
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,520
was UB's money of 260 crores. With the

37
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,200
bank under the control of the government

38
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,079
of Canada court said no. Multiple

39
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,600
international courts, Switzerland

40
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,520
authorities, one of the courts from UK,

41
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,360
they also found you guilty for

42
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,320
misrepresentation of funds.

43
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,799
Do you ever feel sorry that you couldn't

44
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,520
do anything? I apologize publicly to

45
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,840
everyone for the failure of King

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,840
Airlines.

47
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,159
Here's what pissed people off that in

48
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,000
your private life you were enjoying. You

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,160
had a grand birthday party, your 60th

50
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,280
birthday party. Do you think you

51
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,599
shouldn't have done that party? Why?

52
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,080
Somebody mentioned that you took out â‚¬35

53
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,000
million and invested in buying

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,040
properties in France. Rubbish. What

55
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,000
happened between 2012 and 2015? I made

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,760
four settlement offers to the banks

57
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,959
which they refused to accept. 2015 CBI

58
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,800
started investigating you. They found

59
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,760
you ciphering the money.

60
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,040
Third March 2016 case needs to be heard

61
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,480
or needs to be represented in front of

62
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,640
Supreme Court. Second March you left the

63
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,640
bank.

64
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,840
On 15th April, your suspension came for

65
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,239
your passport and 24th April was the

66
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,000
revocation. Why didn't you reply? I'd

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,959
like to show you something. Here is

68
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,800
what is the biggest challenge of doing

69
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,040
business in India? Government. It's in

70
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,360
the Indian DNA. But how did you manage

71
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,000
that before? Would there ever be

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,080
exchange under the table as well? I'm

73
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,840
not going to confirm or deny that

74
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,840
because I leave it to your imagination.

75
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,599
How do you make money now? Do you feel

76
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,680
restricted now? What's your biggest fear

77
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,200
now? Are you prepared for the

78
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,879
worst? Have you ever imagined yourself

79
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,680
actually going to

80
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,959
jail? Would you be willing to return to

81
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,200
country if you're assured fair? If I am

82
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,280
assured, absolutely. I will think about

83
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,010
it seriously. But

84
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:37,280
[Applause]

85
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,519
this episode is not about glorifying a

86
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:43,480
fugitive nor it is about justifying any

87
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,319
wrongs. It's about asking the hard

88
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,360
questions to the man at the center of

89
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,519
one of the India's most controversial

90
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,480
financial stories. After 9 years of

91
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,959
complete media silence, Vijay Malia

92
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,599
chose our podcast figuring out to speak

93
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,720
publicly for the first time. I didn't do

94
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,680
this podcast to celebrate him. I did it

95
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,680
because I was curious. I read his

96
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,920
tweets. I heard the headlines, but I

97
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,799
never heard the full side of the story

98
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,799
because the tweets that he makes are

99
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,720
different than what the headlines talk

100
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,560
about him. There's a mismatch. As a

101
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,479
podcaster, my job is to ask every

102
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,280
uncomfortable question, and I did. Vijay

103
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,759
Malia claims he never committed fraud.

104
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,320
He says he wanted to pay back the loans,

105
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,000
that his properties were seized and

106
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,600
sold, and that he's being framed. He

107
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,520
also says he's ready to face the

108
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,840
consequences, whatever they may be, if

109
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,840
he's given the fair chance of trial.

110
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,840
I've tried to cover his childhood,

111
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,840
business building, the man behind the

112
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,160
image, the rise, the fall, the good, the

113
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,720
bad, and the ugly, the life before, and

114
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,120
the life now. I'm not here to decide

115
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,680
who's right or wrong. I trust the Indian

116
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,919
judicial system to do that. This

117
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,320
conversation is for those who want to

118
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,560
listen, think and question. It's not

119
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,560
about taking sides. It's about

120
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,440
understanding all sides. Watch this

121
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,720
episode with utmost sincerity and let me

122
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,639
know in the comments what do you

123
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,039
think. Welcome on figuring out sir.

124
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:21,960
Thank you

125
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,000
for doing this.

126
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,400
And my

127
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,720
objective of this whole podcast is going

128
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,919
to be that I want to know your side of

129
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,240
story. There are so many things that we

130
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,320
have heard. There are so many things

131
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,600
which are probably right or wrong. I

132
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,520
don't know what's going on. And I think

133
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,199
apart from me, there are millions of

134
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,280
Indians who want to know the same thing.

135
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,560
You're highly talked about. I also feel

136
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,639
that there are so many things which

137
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,600
people have

138
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,680
just heard and started building their

139
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,039
own narrative about you. So I wanted to

140
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:01,960
out

141
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,720
of a in inquisitiveness, curiosity and b

142
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,120
out of a

143
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,160
responsibility I wanted to take this

144
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,400
forward. So thank you so much for doing

145
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,080
this and thank you for giving us an

146
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,240
opportunity. And the best thing which I

147
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,560
really liked about this is when you came

148
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,240
here and you said I'm ready to answer

149
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,680
everything which you want to talk

150
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,800
about. I don't think many people give

151
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,960
that opportunity. So thank you for doing

152
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,400
this. But the first question

153
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,039
is why are you doing this after 9 years?

154
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,039
There are thousands of people who must

155
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,440
have reached out to you over the years.

156
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,360
Why all of a sudden the need after 9

157
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,160
years that okay I'll say yes and yes to

158
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,639
us. Why?

159
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,840
Very good question. Nice place to start.

160
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,720
For the last nine years, I have been the

161
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,919
subject of a

162
00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:00,360
vicious, relentless trial by

163
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,400
media in India who as you have rightly

164
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,080
pointed out have created so many

165
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,639
narratives, negative narratives about me

166
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,680
that I have become a lightning rod of

167
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,599
public

168
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:21,319
anger, being abused, called names,

169
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:23,560
And that was very

170
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,319
unfortunate both professionally and

171
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:30,759
personally. So rather than try and take

172
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:35,039
on this huge Indian media machine, I

173
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,560
just prefer to keep quiet.

174
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,000
Now, times have

175
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,520
changed and I can't help but

176
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,280
recalling that when President Trump was

177
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,000
inaugurated in the first press briefing

178
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,960
by the White House press secretary, she

179
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,720
said that a few seats were now going to

180
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,599
be reserved for the very first time for

181
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,039
people who represented new media or

182
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,360
social media.

183
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,160
I didn't even know that a podcast

184
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,400
existed, let alone understanding what a

185
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,960
podcast really

186
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,560
meant

187
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,919
until you told me and explained it to me

188
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,639
in a manner that I got quite excited

189
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,680
about because here is my

190
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,879
opportunity to not only answer your

191
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,279
questions but to say

192
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:36,560
things that I truly feel would never

193
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,479
ever have been truthfully reported by

194
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,200
the legacy media particularly in

195
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,200
India. That's why I'm here. Why do you

196
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,519
think nobody cared about hearing you

197
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,839
then?

198
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,120
In

199
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,440
India, it's

200
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,279
strange, but public opinion is very

201
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,160
quickly formed and

202
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,399
influenced by the media, more

203
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,519
importantly by sensationalism.

204
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,000
I still remember the anchor of one media

205
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,279
channel in

206
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:17,120
2016 shouting and screaming on the

207
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,920
television saying, "VJ Malia, I want to

208
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,440
see you in jail clothes. I want to see

209
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,880
you eat jail food." With an image of me

210
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,720
in um in jail

211
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,360
attire. What for? I always wondered what

212
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,360
for.

213
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,440
Subsequently, nobody bothered to step

214
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,720
back and think, but it was very easy to

215
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,959
fling false

216
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:58,440
accusations day after

217
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,959
day and get away with it. One of the

218
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:05,920
reasons I agreed to sit with you today

219
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,519
is also because it is only very recently

220
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,600
that finally the government of

221
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,200
India ministry of finance has published

222
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,839
a report their annual report in which

223
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,760
they have acknowledged 14,100 crores

224
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,560
recovered from me. Of course, this was

225
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,640
following the finance minister's

226
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,680
statement in

227
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,399
parliament

228
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:34,000
and the legacy media can't argue with

229
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,920
that

230
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,440
anymore. They can't put any spin on it

231
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,320
anymore.

232
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,800
The debt recovery tribunal gave a

233
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,440
judgment debt of

234
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,600
4,999 crores borrowed by kingfisher

235
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,560
airlines not by Vijay

236
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,399
Malia borrowed by kingfisher airlines of

237
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,560
which Vijay Malia was one of the

238
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,480
guarantors so what is the DRT judgment

239
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,360
debt

240
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,120
4,999 crores plus

241
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,880
1,23 crores unapplied

242
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,240
interest. Okay, which means notional

243
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,360
interest that the banks had not even

244
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,040
booked. Forget that the total of the

245
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,519
unapplied interest and the principal was

246
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:23,079
6203 crores. Okay. And I was a

247
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:26,360
guarantor. The government has recovered

248
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,160
14,100 crores from me. right

249
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,760
now if I had done

250
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,800
chi if I

251
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,360
had duped the

252
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,040
banks

253
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:47,320
where does this all add up till re very

254
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,320
recently there was absolutely no

255
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,640
official figure of

256
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,800
recovery right so everybody the legacy

257
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,240
media in particular wrote whatever they

258
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,760
Ed

259
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,519
right and I was in no position to

260
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:06,279
contradict

261
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:09,040
today after the government of India has

262
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,800
acknowledged the recovery of 14,100

263
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,800
crores I think it's my turn to ask them

264
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,639
what they have to say about it because

265
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,279
you say that a lot of things about you

266
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,320
are false narrative let's go down to

267
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,720
from your childhood we speak from the

268
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,399
beginning and you tell me everything

269
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,880
that people have been said people think

270
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,760
it's wrong and I'll try to present the

271
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,839
facts and the narratives which I have

272
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,440
heard and which I have gathered through

273
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,519
my research. All right. And if you're

274
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,800
okay with counter somewhere, I'll

275
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,959
counter you as well. No, please, please

276
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,440
feel free to counter me. If there's

277
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,079
something that you feel is debatable or

278
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,920
you want to make a counterpoint, I'm

279
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,839
ready for it. Perfect. because I feel

280
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,680
that's my little responsibility out

281
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,800
there to to hear the right side and the

282
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,720
wrong side both and let then people

283
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,480
think about it and let them make the

284
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,880
right call. That's fair. Perfect.

285
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,480
So before even I ask you about childhood

286
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,000
do you do you regret anything?

287
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,519
I regret one

288
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:15,560
thing which is that after all my hard

289
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,600
work, all the value that I created in so

290
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,160
many multiple

291
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,760
ways that effectively the government of

292
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,959
India and of course the

293
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:33,160
media made me a zero from a

294
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,720
hero and that's a fact of life that I

295
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,399
have had to stomach and live with. Now

296
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,959
whether that was justified or not is

297
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,920
something that I'm sure will be

298
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,040
encompassed in your own

299
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,600
questions. Zero from a

300
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,760
hero. Let's talk about building of a

301
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,920
hero first and we'll come down to zero

302
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,519
again. So before the billionaire Vijay

303
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,839
Malia, before the controversy, before

304
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,639
all of this flamboyance and scandals and

305
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,639
things that people talk about, who was

306
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,360
Vijay Malia as a child? Where were you

307
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,120
born? What did you do? How was your

308
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,839
childhood? Tell me about it. Born in

309
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:19,160
Kolkata, moved to a hometown

310
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,320
Bangalore. Went back to Kolkata. did my

311
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,040
schooling there, did my college

312
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,560
education there in

313
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,399
Kolkata and my upbringing under my

314
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:34,360
father was a very

315
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,760
normal I would say strict upbringing

316
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,120
really. Yes. Tell me an incident strict

317
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,760
childhood. Two things. When I was still

318
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,600
in

319
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,760
school, class nine at La Martineer in

320
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,480
Kolkata, my marks were not very good in

321
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,440
class. I was a

322
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,120
mid-ranker only because I took a lot of

323
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,880
interest in sport and extracurricular

324
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,639
activities. I didn't I you know

325
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,680
concentrate fully on studies and my mark

326
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,360
sheets.

327
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,320
And he told me and I think most people

328
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,839
know it. He was exceptionally

329
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:16,959
intelligent. Uh was a product of the

330
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,399
Dune School. I think topped his class.

331
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,240
So he expected me to also top my

332
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,000
class.

333
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,120
Uh nevertheless he said something to me

334
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,760
which I think I remember till

335
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,760
today. Two things made a profound

336
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,560
impact.

337
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,600
one, if you're not good

338
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:45,760
enough, you are not going to step into

339
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,720
my shoes.

340
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,920
And the second thing he

341
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,399
said, he said, "Do you

342
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:56,360
realize that while I say step into my

343
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,720
shoes, there may not be any shoes at all

344
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,800
because the government and its then

345
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,120
socialist

346
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,120
policies may have taken everything away

347
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,399
from us and the only thing I can leave

348
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,959
to you is your education. So take it

349
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,079
seriously." I think I repaid some amount

350
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,199
of faith because

351
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,920
um for my last three years in school 9

352
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,800
10 11 I think I came within the top

353
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,040
three in class and he was quite happy

354
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,199
about that.

355
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,240
So weren't you a little spoiled as child

356
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,959
spoiled? Oh my god. I was anything but

357
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,000
spoiled really. You had all the fancy

358
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,600
toys. You had all the things that

359
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,560
Absolutely no fancy toys at all. That's

360
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,920
completely false

361
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,720
narrative. I after I passed out of

362
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,720
school and when I went to San Javier's

363
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,839
college to study BCOM, my father was

364
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,600
very clear, you go to college at 6:00 in

365
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,079
the morning and when you finish at

366
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,679
10:30, you go and work a full day at the

367
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:08,319
office as a management trainee. I was

368
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,839
put on a stipend of 400 rupees a month

369
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,360
and that 400 rupees never increased

370
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,600
right the

371
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,919
way my time through college. So that's

372
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,880
all I got 400 rupees a month and was

373
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,919
working in those days fips and company

374
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:30,280
limited old courthouse street in

375
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,760
Kolkata every day after college. Aren't

376
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,600
there stories that you used to go to

377
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,799
college in a very fancy car and you

378
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,440
removed the silencer just to show the

379
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,440
the noise of your car, the loudness of

380
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,679
your car and you were always a show off,

381
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,799
weren't you? I was no showoff at all.

382
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,919
And the fancy car that I have was a

383
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,400
secondhand standard herald. So where are

384
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,120
these stories coming from? I don't know.

385
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,559
People's narratives, people's

386
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,600
perceptions. That's why it's important

387
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,799
to correct those

388
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:06,440
perceptions. You know, talking about

389
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,679
noise, even a fat fat in Delhi makes a

390
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:10,919
hell of a lot of

391
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:13,679
noise. You don't have to drive a fancy

392
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,120
car to make a noise down the street.

393
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,760
So, you are telling me that all these

394
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,320
stories of you having a you having fancy

395
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,840
toys, remote control cars, and then

396
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,400
fancy cars with loud noises, all of this

397
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,360
is false. Well, I may have tempered with

398
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,080
the silencer of my car. Okay. Uh because

399
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,720
I was always into kind of fast cars,

400
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,960
loved motor racing and stuff like that,

401
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,799
but you know, I mean, it still remained

402
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,200
a standard held. But why did you do

403
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,880
that? Like just to show off like the

404
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,120
noise and everything. Look, if you can

405
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,320
modify the silencer of a car like you

406
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,280
can modify the the top end of a car's

407
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,559
engine to make it go a little quicker. I

408
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,880
mean that's some that's the basics of of

409
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,440
motorsport. But how were you as a child

410
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,799
like personalitywise? Were you

411
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,679
confident? Were you a little arrogant?

412
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,720
No. No. I look the this is all a

413
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,799
question of

414
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:11,640
perception.

415
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,280
Uh arrogant is also your understanding

416
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,960
of arrogance. My understanding of

417
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,320
arrogance. But I'll tell you one thing.

418
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,160
H

419
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,679
I was always

420
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:28,200
self-confident and whenever I was

421
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,799
invited to give talks at various

422
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,640
universities and educational

423
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,080
establishments I always told the

424
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,360
youngsters that when they start off life

425
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,919
they must be

426
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:44,280
self-confidence because it is only

427
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,400
self-confidence that will bring out the

428
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,760
best in you and I still believe that

429
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,960
till today and because I started

430
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,720
young I am passionate about youth

431
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,440
empowerment but this would have not been

432
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,520
the case always as a kid we all have

433
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,600
like lot of insecurities it's not always

434
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,280
confidence what was your biggest

435
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,000
insecurity when you were growing up I

436
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
don't yeah probably the biggest inse

437
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,600
insecurity was when u the examination

438
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,240
results with you and what my dad would

439
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,919
have to say about

440
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,480
But no beyond that uh you know my life

441
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,760
is pretty plain and simple um great

442
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,400
bunch of school friends, great bunch of

443
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,320
college buddies

444
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,640
um in

445
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,760
Kolkata. uh not the glitzy lights of

446
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,240
Bombay and yeah so it was pretty normal

447
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,080
but you know nothing fancy but I had a

448
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,120
very strict set of supervisors at work

449
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,480
who were clearly instructed by my father

450
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,120
to be tough with me to make sure you

451
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,000
know I worked my butt off and I'm none

452
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,640
the happier for it that's what made me

453
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,080
but did you did you ever get to a

454
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,559
position or in a thinking as a child

455
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,039
that one day I'll be powerful, one day

456
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,320
I'll be very rich? No, absolutely not. I

457
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,799
mean, how could I be so presumptuous?

458
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,400
Here I had a dad who was hands-on

459
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,120
working 24/7

460
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,200
uh

461
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,039
young uh and and uh who told me that if

462
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,600
I didn't measure up, I'd have no place

463
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,799
in the business. So I couldn't be

464
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,360
presumptive could I? But your father was

465
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,520
a wealthy man. In those times there were

466
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,400
only few wealthy people. So you would

467
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,640
pres presume this right? Like I will

468
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,600
have all this wealth inherited. I'll be

469
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,200
maybe bigger than my father or maybe

470
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,640
just have all of these things. I didn't

471
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,840
have any such aspirations in those days.

472
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,679
Uh and and you know wealth was something

473
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,679
that was very relative. Um and and my

474
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,559
father certainly was a very frugal

475
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,760
spender. So uh irrespective of how much

476
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,080
wealth he had, he certainly wasn't

477
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,240
expensive.

478
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,400
You said when you used to go to work,

479
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,679
your father put strict supervisors. Mhm.

480
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,360
Right. What would those strict

481
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,840
supervisors made made you do? What?

482
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,000
Well, first of all, make sure that I

483
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,320
came to the office on time, straight

484
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,280
after college. It wasn't as if I'd sort

485
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,240
of roll up whenever I wanted to. Okay.

486
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,080
The second I was given a clear set of

487
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,400
tasks. Um I was a salesman. I had to go

488
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,200
and visit the shops in the market. I had

489
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,360
to visit

490
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,320
distributors. Um I had to uh spend time

491
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,760
with the accounts department to

492
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,640
understand accounting, corporate

493
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,840
accounting. Um yeah, and marketing, you

494
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,919
know, sit with the ad agencies and stuff

495
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,480
like that. So it was a comprehensive

496
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,320
training program but with no forgiveness

497
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,880
in any sense. I had to work a full day.

498
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,240
I couldn't sort of get up and go uh or

499
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,400
come when I

500
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,360
liked which was fine. I mean um looking

501
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,120
back it was a great grounding.

502
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,720
What happened next? So you were in

503
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,880
Xavier's you started going to work and

504
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,960
then you went to states. Yeah my dad

505
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,039
sent me off to the states to work for

506
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,960
American H. Okay. American Herx as it

507
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,640
was then known became then

508
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,080
Aventus and now the pharmaceutical

509
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,960
company the global companies called

510
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,600
Sanopi. So yeah I was sent there uh

511
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,320
worked there once again um as a

512
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,720
management traininee. I then was brought

513
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,280
to England to work in Jensen and

514
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:48,080
Nicholson. I was a paint foreman in the

515
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,960
paint factory. used to be mixing paint

516
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,120
at

517
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:57,000
night and yeah I mean slowly I

518
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,559
understood what my father's methods were

519
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,960
what were his method which is basically

520
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,200
a

521
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,600
strict training

522
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,720
regimen and I did pretty well because I

523
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,200
can tell you he he expressed he

524
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,240
expressed

525
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,400
um his his appreciation for my work. I

526
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,480
got a a pretty good uh report card from

527
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,679
America. He was he said he was proud of

528
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:30,039
me. Um I did well here in England mixing

529
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:35,840
paint and um when I went back to India

530
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,320
um his health was becoming indifferent

531
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,080
even though he at that time he was only

532
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,520
57 years old. His health was becoming

533
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,760
indifferent. he had a history of heart

534
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:54,320
disease. So he sort of got me to work uh

535
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,640
for him in the core

536
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,720
business and

537
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,240
um yeah then of course the story of

538
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,000
Kingfisher the story of McDonald's

539
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,559
number one backpiper and all these

540
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,360
brands that subsequently became very

541
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,240
wellnown began then. How was your

542
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,120
relationship with your father? The

543
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,559
relationship with my father was

544
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:23,400
excellent. He was a man of few

545
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,240
words. Uh but there's one thing he did

546
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,440
which embarrassed me no end. That every

547
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,760
time he saw me, he gave me a big kiss on

548
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,279
my cheek. Whether it was at an airport

549
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,400
or in the office or at home, he'd give

550
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,080
me a hug and a big kiss on the

551
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:45,840
cheek. I mean bless him for that. Was he

552
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,360
did he ever doubt you that you will be

553
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,679
able whether you will be able to

554
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,200
continue and build his legacy or not? I

555
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,760
think the biggest certificate I got was

556
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,240
from my bosses in America and they gave

557
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,080
me a pretty good certificate a pretty

558
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,440
good report and that finally I think

559
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,240
gave him the confidence to say ah my son

560
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,600
is stepping up to my expectations.

561
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,279
What was your first bold step in your

562
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,440
father's company?

563
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,279
Oh, King Fisher. I went to my father and

564
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,360
I said, "I need 10 lakhs rupees to

565
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,480
market Kingfisher beer." He said,

566
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,400
"That's a princely sum of money. What

567
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,600
are you going to do with it? How are you

568
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,200
going to do it? Etc., etc." Because I

569
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,919
saw in the archives of United Breweries

570
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,000
this label of King Fusha Beer, which had

571
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,600
been actually launched in

572
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,880
1857, okay? gathering dust and you know

573
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,000
with a pretty archaic kingfisher bird on

574
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,200
it sort of prehistoric

575
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,480
version but I said to myself the the

576
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,360
mere word brand

577
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,120
kingfisher is very evocative in so many

578
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,919
ways it could be made into a fun brand.

579
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:04,000
Now my time in Kolkata going back to my

580
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,840
training days when I spent time with

581
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,320
them with the marketing department more

582
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,919
importantly interacted with the people

583
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,480
in the advertising agencies. my time in

584
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,960
America where

585
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,600
um you know I still

586
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,360
remember the two big banks which is Bank

587
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,240
of America and City Banks and City Bank

588
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,120
said the city never sleeps and Bank of

589
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,520
America came out saying we caught the

590
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,320
city napping you know that was the level

591
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,400
of marketing advertising tongue-in-cheek

592
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,320
stuff which caught your attention and so

593
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,159
I became fascinated with marketing

594
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,760
And I came away back to India started

595
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,799
working in the business and I always

596
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:52,840
said a brand needs a

597
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,679
personality. Of

598
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:57,679
course I very quickly realized in India

599
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,640
I couldn't replicate what they did in

600
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,919
America because for alcohol India is a

601
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,559
media dark environment where the

602
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:11,279
the advertising of alcohol is banned.

603
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:15,559
So in a way I had to think of ways of

604
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:19,360
authoring surrogate advertising

605
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,720
uh which I did pretty

606
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,320
successfully you know not some Mickey

607
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,320
Mouse

608
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,320
stuff where if you want to advertise an

609
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,360
alcoholic brand that you sort of

610
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,200
suddenly you know produce some music

611
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,520
cassettes and I built a full water

612
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,760
business around

613
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,200
Kingfisher and a bought a business of

614
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,039
sign significant enough size

615
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,360
uh that you could justify advertising

616
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,520
it. Okay. And therefore you you

617
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,159
advertise the core brand.

618
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:58,159
So I gave King Fisher a very colorful

619
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,159
personality

620
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,120
because that's what evokes

621
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,120
you

622
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,240
know like Magdal number

623
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,240
one golden moments Magdal

624
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,880
moments it's evocative it's supposed to

625
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,440
convey that you know if you want to hang

626
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,960
out and have a good time with your

627
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,320
friend golden moments well it's the

628
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,600
Macdonald moment. So there were many

629
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,559
many such

630
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:33,360
examples of how I actually gave brands

631
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,559
their

632
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:37,640
personalities

633
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,799
and in many ways I supplemented by

634
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,320
becoming the brand ambassador

635
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,600
myself and all of this was happening

636
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,399
when your father was still alive. Oh

637
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:50,000
absolutely absolutely.

638
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,760
You said India was media dark when it

639
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,080
comes to alcohol which still is the

640
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,039
reality and there was a point where I

641
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,840
think government banned alcohol. No, no,

642
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,320
no, no. Or what was that? Certain states

643
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,720
introduced prohibition

644
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,039
such as Andhra Pradesh, unified Andhra

645
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,799
Pradesh.

646
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,520
Of course, Gujarat has always been dry.

647
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,640
But the advertise advertising of alcohol

648
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,480
is banned in India and has been banned

649
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,120
and still is banned. When was that? When

650
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,840
was this time when you started acquiring

651
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,399
a lot of alcohol brands?

652
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,880
uh because a lot of those brands were

653
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,559
scared of the state because the state

654
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,640
were was getting involved in the alcohol

655
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,240
business or maybe they wanted to ban or

656
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,559
prohibit certain things. What was this

657
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,799
time where you started acquiring certain

658
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,240
alcohol brands and cheap because you and

659
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,679
your father was bullish on it.

660
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:47,200
No, that was in 1977 when Majaraji Desai

661
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,320
was the prime minister of India and he

662
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,320
publicly announced that there should be

663
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,279
prohibition all India. Okay. Okay. which

664
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,120
means that alcohol should be banned

665
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,399
across the country. So obviously the

666
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,919
stocks the value of the stocks and

667
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:06,480
shares of almost all alcoholic beverage

668
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,080
companies whether distilleries or

669
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,679
breweries fell. M my father was very

670
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,799
clear that prohibition could never

671
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,640
succeed in India and

672
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,440
therefore he

673
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,760
bought and so that's how we became

674
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,039
number one by quite a fair

675
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:28,640
distance because all those who panicked

676
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,799
and sold

677
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:33,279
out my father acquired.

678
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:34,799
But was there something you guys knew

679
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,640
which others didn't or it was just pure

680
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,720
conviction? No, it was just pure

681
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,480
conviction because we knew that uh

682
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,399
prohibition had not even succeeded in

683
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,360
the United States. And plus, if you look

684
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,919
at the amount of revenue

685
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:53,519
generation for the state governments

686
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,320
through the sale of alcohol, there's no

687
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,320
way in the world that prohibition would

688
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,679
have succeeded in India. What h what

689
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,840
happened after your father's death? You

690
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,519
were doing this successful stint. You

691
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,200
were taking bold steps. You wanted to

692
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,440
make alcohol a cool brand. All of this

693
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,640
is happening. Everything was going

694
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,799
right.

695
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:18,320
Right. What happened then? Well, um I

696
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:24,760
was in I was in the US. I gone to

697
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,519
finalize promotion and export of Black

698
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,919
Dog Scotch whiskey.

699
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,519
uh when my father sadly passed away at a

700
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,799
cocktail party in in then

701
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:40,799
Bombay

702
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,880
and he was only

703
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,000
59. Uh nobody ever expected him to pass

704
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,360
so young. I was just past

705
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,960
27. So I took the air and death flight

706
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,279
and flew back from New

707
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:01,679
York and performed my father's last

708
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,679
rights.

709
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:08,519
Then the fun began

710
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:11,200
because my father surrounded himself

711
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,640
with a few

712
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,519
stalwarts. Yeah. Meaning people who he

713
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,600
put in positions of great

714
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,760
authority who were also very close to

715
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,159
him personally.

716
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:30,279
So he

717
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:33,440
had somebody running the western India

718
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,440
businesses, somebody running the eastern

719
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,279
India

720
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:38,159
businesses, somebody running the

721
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,519
southern India

722
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:43,120
businesses. And don't ever forget in

723
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,399
those days the structure was that United

724
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,519
Breweries Limited was the the holding

725
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:52,960
company and the other companies in the

726
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,080
group were largely

727
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,519
controlled by its largest shareholder

728
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:01,360
United Breweries or they were subsidiary

729
00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:05,440
companies. And so the inevitable debate

730
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,720
started on what

731
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,359
next, what role I should have. Of

732
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,200
course, people acknowledged that I was

733
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,919
in the business.

734
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:17,480
Uh

735
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,679
but people I think were a little

736
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,879
reticent to speak openly about

737
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:27,399
uh their own aspirations of being the

738
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,760
chairman. Then something very funny

739
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,480
happened. We had uh annual general

740
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,040
meeting of shareholders that

741
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,800
uh was coming due. Mhm.

742
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,359
And the shareholders in the front line

743
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:44,359
who had seen me with my

744
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:47,000
dad proposed my

745
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,079
name and that's

746
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:53,560
how all other aspirants were

747
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,800
silenced because they couldn't publicly

748
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,320
sort of get up and say that they were

749
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,480
more

750
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,920
qualified particularly when it was

751
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,280
evident I had shareholder support. M and

752
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,520
there I was. I was installed in what I

753
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,800
call the hot seat at a very young age.

754
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,599
But fortunately, thanks to my

755
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:17,880
upbringing, my father's

756
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,119
insistence on proper training,

757
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,079
familiarization with the business, time

758
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:24,920
in

759
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:29,160
America, time working with him. I wasn't

760
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:34,000
raw. I had a fair amount under my belt

761
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,760
to be able to address the challenge of

762
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,680
the role. I was reading an article where

763
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:46,480
u it said that you didn't trust people

764
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,640
who was who were in control at the time

765
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,119
of your father's uh when your father was

766
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,520
a chairman. So that's why you hired your

767
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,160
people and your friends because you

768
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,599
didn't know that if you could actually

769
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,240
go to them for the right advice or no.

770
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,320
No, no, no. That's completely

771
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,040
misleading. It's false. I never hired

772
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,240
any of my friends. But let's put it this

773
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,040
way. They would have been too young and

774
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,119
inexperienced. In any case, you know, I

775
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,320
mean, as I said, I was barely 28. They

776
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,640
would be my contemporaries. M so the

777
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,200
question of hiring them and putting them

778
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,040
in management positions just didn't

779
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,440
arise but I encouraged a lot of

780
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,240
professional from within I mean people

781
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,000
who then became the president of the

782
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,599
spirits division of the breweries

783
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,560
division and all the rest of it I mean

784
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:41,680
my father's time the average age of the

785
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,839
regional directors of the regional

786
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,720
satrups was probably around 60 between

787
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,200
60 and 65 and in In five years after I

788
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,839
reorganized, I mean the average age was

789
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:56,960
about 40. Okay. And these were all

790
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,440
professional managers promoted from

791
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,000
within the ranks.

792
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,680
I mean yes there were couple of

793
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,240
exceptions where I hired people from

794
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,880
extremely well-known organizations

795
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,599
uh like major consultancy firms so on so

796
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,320
forth but beyond that largely it was all

797
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,240
internal promotion.

798
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,920
compare or give me differences

799
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,680
between

800
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:24,240
before okay so when your father was the

801
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,079
chairman versus when you were the

802
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,920
chairman give me three four differences

803
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,000
what happened in United briefies

804
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
it was the entire approach for instance

805
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,880
mine was a

806
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,640
decentralized accountability approach

807
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,320
okay

808
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,960
uh I would have

809
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,760
monthly operating review meetings called

810
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,520
MS for each line of business. Okay.

811
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,920
And that's all I wanted to know about

812
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,720
how the businesses were performing on a

813
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,760
regular day-to-day basis. I wasn't

814
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,800
leaning over the shoulders of the

815
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,040
management team and trying to

816
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,440
micromanage

817
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,440
things. Um when opportunities came

818
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,440
along,

819
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,520
uh then of course we'd had separate

820
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:16,040
discussions. So if you empower

821
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,560
people, accountability comes along with

822
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,280
it because people are

823
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:25,000
also motivated to demonstrate their own

824
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,320
capabilities. Now my father's style was

825
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,480
as I said far more hands-on owner

826
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,079
operated micromanaging management style

827
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:39,359
and he spent a lot of time doing it. Um

828
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,160
I had a lot of free

829
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,960
time. Um as I will tell you as we

830
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,280
proceed because because of this

831
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,520
decentralization and this whole new

832
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,440
management culture Mhm. that I had

833
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,680
enough time in your um introduced in in

834
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,839
the UB

835
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:01,440
group and this was between let's say

836
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,200
1983 and

837
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,119
1986

838
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:10,599
87 that is why I was able to

839
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:13,920
then acquire the Burgger paints global

840
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,720
business based here in the UK and

841
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,400
actually become a non-resident Indian

842
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,560
in ' 86 88 8 Okay Yeah. And I still have

843
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,680
a letter from the Reserve Bank of India

844
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,839
confirming that from 1988 I would be

845
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,520
treated as a non-resident Indian

846
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,680
uh for tax and exchange control

847
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,680
purposes. And the reason I and of course

848
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,680
that obviously meant that I couldn't

849
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,640
spend more than 180 days in India. Mhm.

850
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,400
Well, the luxury of spending 180 days

851
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,480
out of India running this new

852
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,800
opportunity in international business

853
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,800
means business. Uh I was able to do it

854
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,599
only because of the decentralized

855
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,560
management structure implemented in

856
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,119
India. So

857
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:08,720
both the foreign businesses and the

858
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,599
Indian businesses ran very well.

859
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,880
Give me differences and similarities

860
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:18,079
between Vital Malia and Vijay Malia.

861
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,079
Well, Vital Malia's

862
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:23,920
thought 100 times about spending money.

863
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,520
Vijay Malia probably thought

864
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,040
twice.

865
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:32,320
Um yeah, you know, I guess it's age. Um

866
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,000
it's aspiration, its age,

867
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,599
it's

868
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:38,880
different styles and outlook on life.

869
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,800
Was there any difference in terms

870
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,720
of public attention as well? You were

871
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,160
pretty loud. Your personality was I No,

872
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,960
look, once again, you can think whatever

873
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,960
you want to think of me and so can the

874
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,720
whole world.

875
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,240
Just because I'm a self-confident guy

876
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,079
who is not afraid of public

877
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:08,760
speaking who doesn't suffer from stage

878
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,560
fright. If you want to say that I am

879
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,599
arrogant,

880
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:16,800
flamboyant, go ahead and say it. I can't

881
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,400
deny it. My father was very shy of

882
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,880
public

883
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,720
speaking. Totally the opposite. I am a

884
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,680
very confident public speaker. I used to

885
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,880
debate in school. I used to participate

886
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,599
in drama in

887
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:34,280
school.

888
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:38,160
So I can speak.

889
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,720
So you didn't want public recognition.

890
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,960
You loved speaking. No. Well, if

891
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,720
somebody asked me a question or I was

892
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,839
invited to speak, I'd speak and people

893
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,960
would well in some cases tell me I'm

894
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,839
talking nonsense and in most cases say

895
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:57,720
they liked my speak. But I was able to

896
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,359
communicate from a platform.

897
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,520
But won't you speak certain things and

898
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,359
tweak your speeches in a way that that

899
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,280
becomes headlines?

900
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,000
I never looked for headlines. I never

901
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,640
ever looked for headlines.

902
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,000
The headlines were created around me by

903
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,200
the

904
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,119
media. You know, let's take the case of

905
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,200
flamboyance.

906
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,200
Okay? And let's spend a minute on

907
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,839
analyzing flamboyance.

908
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:31,400
To me, flamboyance

909
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,400
means loving

910
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,160
life and appreciating the good things in

911
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,119
life. That's what flamboyance is.

912
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,760
In a public way. Okay.

913
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,720
That is what I would say is the meaning

914
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,440
of

915
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,640
lambards. How old was I when my father

916
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,760
died?

917
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,000
28. Compare me to other industrialists

918
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,560
in India at that time. I was 28. I was

919
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,599
chairman of UB group. Who was chairman

920
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:02,680
of RPG enterprises? Mr. Ra

921
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,640
Prasad. Who was the chairman of

922
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,599
Reliance?

923
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:10,960
Dhubayani. who was the uh chairman of

924
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,960
the Brila group Mr. BK

925
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:20,599
Bella I was a contemporary of their

926
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:22,200
children

927
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,560
but I was thrown into the deep end. So I

928
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,319
was a group chairman being compared to

929
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:33,440
people who were my father's age.

930
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,880
Now as a

931
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,920
youngster I had the the passions of

932
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,800
young people like I

933
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,880
enjoyed a good

934
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,599
car. I

935
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:50,680
enjoyed my

936
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,200
drinks. I enjoyed parties. I enjoyed

937
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,000
music. I enjoyed sport.

938
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,400
Not all of my father's contemporaries

939
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,160
who suddenly became my contemporaries in

940
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,640
business lived that way. They were more

941
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,079
conservative, you know, more at home,

942
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:13,480
more domestic, consistent with their own

943
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:17,839
age. So suddenly the media decided, huh,

944
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,599
this guy, chairman of UB group, is

945
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:23,680
flamboyant. I was flam termed flamboyant

946
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,520
only because I did what every other

947
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,160
youngster aspired to do.

948
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,520
You know, I mean, at the end of the

949
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:33,480
day, you have to make

950
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,000
allowances, age related allowances.

951
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,240
Let's put it that

952
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,319
way. But it's okay. I have no regrets. I

953
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,440
I didn't I didn't spend anybody else's

954
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,599
money. I spent my own money. I lived my

955
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:50,359
life the way I wanted to live my life.

956
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:55,400
Uh if I look back, I've got millions of

957
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,319
miles of

958
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:59,920
corporate experience under my belt

959
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,760
starting off at a very young

960
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:07,520
age and um I hope people appreciate the

961
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,160
more positive contributions that I have

962
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,040
made rather than the persistently

963
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:16,160
negative narrative that has overtaken

964
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,319
and overshadowed

965
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:21,440
a effectively a whole career. I don't

966
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,560
think I ever use that word

967
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,400
flamboy. It was the media and the

968
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,480
narrative they created around me that

969
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,560
was

970
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,560
flamboyant for their own purposes.

971
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:37,640
Now I just lived like any

972
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:42,240
other moderately wealthy 28 year old

973
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:46,160
would live. No. Yeah. extraordinary

974
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,400
life. How can it be extraordinary? In

975
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,359
what way? Do you know what the exchange

976
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:53,599
controls were in India? Do you know if

977
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:55,200
you could import a Ferrari in India?

978
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,440
Today you can. But go back to the

979
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,800
198586. Could you import a Ferrari? No

980
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,720
way in the world. So did you or did you

981
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,640
not? You could only buy cars from the

982
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,119
state trading

983
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:08,319
corporation through an auction process

984
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:10,400
in Delhi.

985
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,319
But you ended up buying all of them. I

986
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:13,079
could

987
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:17,040
not. later you bought it. Look, I like

988
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,079
good cars. I race cars. I've been racing

989
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:21,640
cars since I was a

990
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,720
teenager. Okay, I brought a Formula 1

991
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,520
car into India to race. Okay, when my

992
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,079
father was still alive. In fact, when I

993
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,400
won the race at

994
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:35,200
Scholabaram, okay, near then Madras, now

995
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,280
Chennai, I called him from the racetrack

996
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,040
and said, "I won the race." He was very

997
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,839
happy. So it wasn't as if I was trying

998
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:44,880
to do things behind people's back. But

999
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,960
okay, I was fond of motorsports back

1000
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,200
then.

1001
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,119
Okay. So it came from media. But did you

1002
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,480
enjoy the tag of your Where did I have

1003
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,560
the time to enjoy or spend my time and

1004
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,319
energy denying? I just lived my life,

1005
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:06,599
did my work. And I think whoever you may

1006
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:12,400
ask I work really hard. See this is

1007
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:15,040
very okay this is very like a media

1008
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:19,280
answer. Okay. U what did you were aware

1009
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,040
that people call you Flip Point. You

1010
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,960
were aware that this was the image built

1011
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,960
being built. You were aware that

1012
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,400
headline. What was your reaction? What

1013
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,800
did you start secretly? Did you enjoy

1014
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,599
it? No way. So what was the reaction the

1015
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:34,960
moment people would write it you like

1016
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,880
ignore it? Of course I would ignore it.

1017
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,240
What have I done for the last 9 years?

1018
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,400
But at that time you peak you let me

1019
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,839
tell you something

1020
00:47:44,839 --> 00:47:48,079
being referred to as flamboyant some

1021
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:52,119
people may take as a compliment but

1022
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,880
nobody will

1023
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,160
tolerate being called chore,

1024
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,680
thief,

1025
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,760
fugitive. Right? These are damning

1026
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,400
words. I ignored all of it because I

1027
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,599
knew I couldn't fight it much like I

1028
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:09,160
ignored

1029
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,599
flamboyance. I couldn't spend all my

1030
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:15,040
time devoted to contradicting what the

1031
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,440
media

1032
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:22,720
wrote. Yeah. And now but okay let me

1033
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,200
also tell you I referred to earlier I

1034
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,559
said you know this

1035
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:30,359
whole theme of

1036
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:33,520
flamboyance the media if you'd see the

1037
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,839
pattern of their reportage on me okay I

1038
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:40,800
mean and they kept on writing things

1039
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,359
which really I thought these guys don't

1040
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:48,000
have anything better to do vija party

1041
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,319
vijay mala is hosting Newest party at

1042
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:53,040
King Fishella Vij Malia is doing this

1043
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,359
that and other things. Okay. Bottom line

1044
00:48:56,359 --> 00:48:58,760
is they

1045
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:02,599
created a narrative of a

1046
00:49:02,599 --> 00:49:04,800
personality that helped them to sell

1047
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,760
their own media. One day there was a

1048
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:12,920
terribly wrong factually incorrect

1049
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,640
uh article in one of the large

1050
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,359
newspapers in India. So I called the

1051
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:20,319
owner. Yes.

1052
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:21,880
How could you

1053
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,359
possibly publish something like this

1054
00:49:24,359 --> 00:49:27,920
without checking the facts?

1055
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,599
Vijay, sorry. Your name

1056
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:34,160
sells. So they created this animal

1057
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,040
called Vijay Malia whose name started

1058
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,319
selling so they could they could they

1059
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:42,079
could they could you know get more

1060
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,800
eyeballs, more readership, more

1061
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,520
viewership. But be that as it may, I

1062
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,359
lived my life. What was my

1063
00:49:50,359 --> 00:49:54,079
objectives? I am not apologetic for the

1064
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:55,400
life I

1065
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,839
lived because I didn't spend anybody

1066
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:01,119
else's money except my own.

1067
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:05,319
I didn't borrow one rupee from

1068
00:50:05,319 --> 00:50:09,319
anybody. Okay?

1069
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,240
I

1070
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,319
was much

1071
00:50:15,319 --> 00:50:18,599
maligned, much

1072
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:21,359
complimented, but effectively I was my

1073
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:22,920
own brand

1074
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:26,760
ambassador. Take the case of

1075
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,319
one muchtalked about phrase, king of

1076
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:32,480
good times. Yeah.

1077
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,880
I'm not

1078
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:38,079
crazy to walk around with a label on my

1079
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:40,119
chest saying king of good

1080
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:43,680
times read. And this is where somebody

1081
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,800
must make the

1082
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:49,480
effort. See the label of the king vishab

1083
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,359
beia that was

1084
00:50:52,359 --> 00:50:55,680
developed. It says the king of good

1085
00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:00,440
times. The personality of King Fisher

1086
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:05,280
Bear was the king of good times. Ulta

1087
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,280
media started calling me the king of

1088
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,520
good

1089
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:13,480
times. So tell me being the king of good

1090
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:17,280
times will not help sell the beer. But

1091
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,480
it did the because the beer itself was

1092
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,599
the genuine king of good

1093
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:26,319
times. And the personality that I gave

1094
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:30,079
King Fisher, promoting sport, promoting

1095
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,200
fashion, promoting

1096
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:36,160
music, sponsoring motor racing. So all

1097
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,119
the stuff that's exciting to

1098
00:51:38,119 --> 00:51:40,800
youngsters that represented the

1099
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,760
personality of the King Fisher

1100
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,240
brand. That's why King

1101
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:48,160
Fisher was such a success. But talk to

1102
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,200
me about building of King Fisher. Don't

1103
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,520
you think it was a like at least that's

1104
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,400
what I think it was a very well curated

1105
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,440
strategy that I will become a brand

1106
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,480
which represents King Fisher. No, I was

1107
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,760
brand

1108
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:07,520
ambassador and I have done it not only

1109
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,160
for King Fisher but take the case of our

1110
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,280
spirits business. I actually came on

1111
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,079
national television with an ad

1112
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:17,640
encouraging

1113
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:21,400
people not to drink and

1114
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,800
drive. I did it myself. I didn't get

1115
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,319
some film star to do

1116
00:52:27,319 --> 00:52:30,960
it. I did it myself. So bu becoming a

1117
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,960
personal brand was a strategy then. Of

1118
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,760
course it was. So then why does it

1119
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,599
bother you that you wouldn't bother me

1120
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:39,839
act as like the king of bothered me? But

1121
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:42,400
that's what I'm saying. But I am not the

1122
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,640
person who labeled myself as king of

1123
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,559
good times. You happened that the media

1124
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:50,079
started calling me the king of good

1125
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,480
times. Fine because subtly you c curated

1126
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,720
this. No, I didn't curate king of good

1127
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:58,720
times. In what way? By actually

1128
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,640
promoting a lifestyle which every young

1129
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,119
person would aspire to. Why not? People

1130
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:05,240
young people are entitled to

1131
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,880
aspirations. M young people are

1132
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:11,359
entitled to improve lifestyles. Young

1133
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:15,319
people are entitled to to treat

1134
00:53:15,319 --> 00:53:16,839
themselves.

1135
00:53:16,839 --> 00:53:20,000
Um yeah, but that doesn't mean I went

1136
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,760
around the whole world saying, "Well,

1137
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,520
you know what? I'm the king of good

1138
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,880
times." No way. Never said it even once.

1139
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,800
But you knew it will happen. No, I

1140
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,880
didn't. How should I care? I achieved my

1141
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,680
objective of making King the number one

1142
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,640
selling beer. That's it. How did that

1143
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,800
happen? What happened along the way is

1144
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,960
is irrelevant. Okay. How did this

1145
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,880
happen? King Fisher beer. How did it

1146
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,119
become number one? Tell me story of King

1147
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:49,880
Fisher. Well, when I took over this

1148
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:53,200
business, Golden Eagle or Mo Breweries

1149
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,839
was the largest beer company in India.

1150
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:58,000
Today, United Breweries Limited controls

1151
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,359
almost 52% of the beer market in India.

1152
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:05,200
King Fisher is is I mean not very many

1153
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,280
product categories that can can

1154
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,800
lay claim to 52% market national market

1155
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:14,720
share but yeah Kingfisher is by far the

1156
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:18,079
number one selling brand that's because

1157
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:21,040
yes I cured a personality around

1158
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,680
Kingfisher around fun around excitement

1159
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,880
around vibrancy color I created the

1160
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,440
brand and I achieved my objective you

1161
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:33,040
take the case of of of Mcdal number one.

1162
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,319
I mean once again this whole golden

1163
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:42,880
moments, Mcdal moments, right? Uh it was

1164
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,119
a little more sober than the Kingfisher

1165
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:49,760
ads because the target demographic was

1166
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,319
different but it's the largest selling

1167
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:55,440
whiskey in the world today.

1168
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,760
Number one,

1169
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,200
right? All these brands I created.

1170
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,839
Tell me one turning point which just

1171
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:06,559
made everything good for you in King

1172
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:10,079
Fisher. Kingfisher beer specifically.

1173
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,040
It's a sustained effort. But what was

1174
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,480
when was the first time you thought okay

1175
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,720
now it'll work because it was always

1176
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:20,240
working it as the from day one. Yeah.

1177
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:23,280
When I relaunched it new packaging,

1178
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,599
right? Make it more appealing on the

1179
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:27,520
shelf.

1180
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:31,240
uh started sponsoring music, fashion,

1181
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:34,359
events, got more brand

1182
00:55:34,359 --> 00:55:36,880
attention. Automatically the sales

1183
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,079
started picking up and then you know as

1184
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:43,559
we went along promoting our marketing

1185
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:46,720
strategy which was clearly effective,

1186
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,400
the sales

1187
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:52,079
followed. Same thing with with Macdonald

1188
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:53,520
number one whiskey. Nothing is

1189
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,359
overnight.

1190
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:59,359
National brands are not built overnight.

1191
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:00,799
There wasn't one moment that you could

1192
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:04,079
point pinpoint or was it? How can you

1193
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,480
how can you pinpoint a moment because it

1194
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,119
isn't like switching on and off a light

1195
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:12,160
switch. Why did you get conviction that

1196
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,240
King Bishop beer will work because it

1197
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,119
was little expensive than other ones.

1198
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:21,400
We had brands such as UB

1199
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:26,000
Royal, Flying Horse, we had Jubilee. Now

1200
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,760
you tell me even though they were my

1201
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,680
brands, does any one of these evoke any

1202
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,319
excitement in you? No. But if I say to

1203
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:36,720
you King Fisher, I mean you take notice,

1204
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,319
right? So that's the platform I built

1205
00:56:39,319 --> 00:56:43,359
on. All right. Similarly, I said I mean

1206
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:45,920
you take the case of of Macdonald number

1207
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,640
one, right? It was

1208
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:52,599
uh targeted at uh slightly higher

1209
00:56:52,599 --> 00:56:57,200
demographic, but it went along with more

1210
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,319
sophisticated

1211
00:56:59,319 --> 00:57:02,720
um uh merchandising and stuff like that

1212
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,520
which which which ordered well for the

1213
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,680
brand. And today as the Indian economy

1214
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,559
has grown as consumer spending power has

1215
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:13,839
gone up it's the world's biggest

1216
00:57:14,119 --> 00:57:17,839
brand selling about 32 million cases per

1217
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:21,040
year. What was the biggest challenge in

1218
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,400
building of King Fisher

1219
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:27,760
bec I think or everything was just

1220
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,000
painted red and it worked out for you.

1221
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,400
No no there was nothing red about

1222
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,599
Macdonald. It was all black and gold. Uh

1223
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:38,640
the only one around that's red is King

1224
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:42,799
Fisher. No, I think more than

1225
00:57:42,839 --> 00:57:45,680
challenges I look at opportunities. I

1226
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:48,400
mean you know 2005 I bought Shawless my

1227
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,200
biggest competitor. I mean that

1228
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:54,640
propelled the spirits business I mean to

1229
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,839
number one position by far brought on

1230
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:00,079
board banks like Royal Challenge and all

1231
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:02,359
the rest of it. So I mean those were

1232
00:58:02,359 --> 00:58:06,079
pretty bold business decisions which

1233
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:09,359
once again self-confidence. I had to pay

1234
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:13,200
$300 million for the company. Big amount

1235
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,839
of money but made it work. That's how

1236
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:18,960
United Spirits was created today with a

1237
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,400
market cap of almost one lakh crores. So

1238
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,880
you know I mean she had the confidence

1239
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,760
to do it. You go do it. You said you

1240
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,280
bought Bojo paints at the same time.

1241
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,280
talk about that. Why paints all of a

1242
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,720
sudden you were making money with

1243
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,880
alcohol? You were minting profits out of

1244
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,440
alcohol. You were convinced that brands

1245
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,480
like King Fisher and then at one point

1246
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,079
other brands as well would work out

1247
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:50,040
really well, which it did. Why

1248
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:54,720
buying a paint business like this is so

1249
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:58,040
the paint British paints in

1250
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:01,559
India. Okay. which is now called Burgger

1251
00:59:01,559 --> 00:59:03,079
Paintants

1252
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:07,040
was part of the Hex Group. My father was

1253
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,920
chairman of British Paints India. Okay.

1254
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,960
When he passed away, I became chairman

1255
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,760
of British Paints

1256
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:22,000
India. During my tenure as chairman of

1257
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,200
British Paints India, I learned

1258
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,799
something about the paint business.

1259
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:30,200
Right. Now,

1260
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:35,040
what did you learn about paint business?

1261
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:38,119
Go back in time what I told

1262
00:59:38,119 --> 00:59:40,599
you. When I was

1263
00:59:40,599 --> 00:59:43,839
sent to America, then to England, I

1264
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:47,040
worked as a foreman in the Ber Jensen

1265
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,880
Nicholson paint factory here in this

1266
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,240
country.

1267
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:53,319
So I not only knew

1268
00:59:53,319 --> 00:59:57,359
about making paint but also how a paint

1269
00:59:57,359 --> 00:59:59,359
business was run because I was chairman

1270
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:01,400
of

1271
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,720
budgets. So when Hex Group decided to

1272
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,599
sell their global budget pens,

1273
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:10,880
headquartered in England, operating in

1274
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,359
the Caribbean, operating

1275
01:00:14,359 --> 01:00:16,040
in

1276
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:19,359
Africa, in uh Asia, the true

1277
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:22,079
multinational company.

1278
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:27,559
Uh I went to them and put together a

1279
01:00:27,559 --> 01:00:31,359
um loan package with those days the Hong

1280
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,480
Kong and Shanghai Banking

1281
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:37,400
Corporation and bought it because I had

1282
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:41,280
this aspiration of creating India's

1283
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,599
first

1284
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:47,319
multinational that was back yeah I said

1285
01:00:47,319 --> 01:00:51,720
1988. Okay. So from being a

1286
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:55,200
Indiancentric business I was operating

1287
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,240
in 25 countries worldwide flying the

1288
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,559
Indian

1289
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:04,559
flag. So your objective is only that I

1290
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:07,520
want to take India or Indian business to

1291
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:11,599
the world. No absolutely not. I I I I

1292
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:14,040
was was

1293
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:18,000
uh very focused on making a hefty profit

1294
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,200
out of it too. All right. Uh which I

1295
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,480
successfully did. So I bought it in a

1296
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:28,920
leverage buyout. Mhm.

1297
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:32,040
And after that I did

1298
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:36,480
IPOs. I did IPOs in Jamaica. I did IPOs

1299
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,520
on the Kenyan Stock Exchange. I did an

1300
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,480
IPO on the Singapore Stock

1301
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:46,359
Exchange and diluted our shareholding to

1302
01:01:46,359 --> 01:01:49,440
51%. But used the proceeds of the IPO to

1303
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:50,520
pay down the

1304
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:55,200
debt, right? And then finally in 1996, I

1305
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,760
sold the entire business that was then

1306
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,720
listed on the Singapore Stock

1307
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:03,720
Exchange and I made a fat

1308
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:07,359
profit. And I still remember and I have

1309
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:09,200
no hesitation in saying this that I went

1310
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,240
to my mom and I said, "You see this

1311
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:15,079
piece of paper? This is what I

1312
01:02:15,079 --> 01:02:17,240
earned. This is not

1313
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:20,359
inherited. I made it

1314
01:02:20,359 --> 01:02:24,559
myself. So when I spend it, don't

1315
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:27,280
complain." And that's on a lighter end.

1316
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:31,200
Yeah, I mean I I I that was when as a

1317
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:35,200
non-resident Indian I made my first

1318
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,559
serious piece of money out of entirely

1319
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:39,640
my own

1320
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:42,920
initiative in a pence

1321
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:46,240
environment. But hey, that's is what

1322
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,559
it's all about. I mean I got experience

1323
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:50,880
of doing IPOs in three different

1324
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:54,079
countries across the globe. That was in

1325
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:56,559
invaluable experience. Do you regret

1326
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:58,319
selling it? Because today BGER is I

1327
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:01,599
think 60 70,000 cr big business. That's

1328
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:05,839
only one BGER in India. I own the global

1329
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:09,119
BGER all over the world including India.

1330
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:13,920
I sold Bger paints in India to dingas.

1331
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,280
So do you regret selling? A great job

1332
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,000
with it. No, God bless them. They did a

1333
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,039
super job with it. But it was if it was

1334
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:23,359
doing so good, why did you sell it then?

1335
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:25,359
Well, uh, it was bought by the

1336
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:27,280
Malaysians.

1337
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,280
Okay. And they came with an offer I

1338
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,280
couldn't refuse. I mean, okay. They

1339
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,960
offered me some two and a half times the

1340
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:36,280
quoted shapers.

1341
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:40,240
Okay. You mentioned that you said you

1342
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:41,920
told your mother that I made this

1343
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:44,400
profit. Now don't complain when I spend

1344
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,119
it. Correct. Tell me about relationship

1345
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:49,359
with your mother. My mom brought me up.

1346
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:52,760
I used to live with her in Kolkata alone

1347
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:55,319
since ' 64

1348
01:03:55,319 --> 01:04:00,400
65 and yeah so she's stood by me like a

1349
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:04,240
rock she's a very well educated lady

1350
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,799
um and yeah I mean she's been living in

1351
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:09,480
England now for 30 plus

1352
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,880
years

1353
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:14,480
but yeah I mean you know I mean I wanted

1354
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:15,640
to buy a

1355
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:18,640
yacht I wanted to buy a plane and stuff

1356
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:21,039
like like that. And so I wanted to make

1357
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:22,960
sure I set the record straight. I told

1358
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:25,280
my mom I earned this money. So if I

1359
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,880
spend it buying a yacht and spend it

1360
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:29,200
buying a plane, don't complain. Did she

1361
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,680
complain? Oh, no. Never. But why did you

1362
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,839
say that? She enjoyed the art. What?

1363
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:35,760
Okay. Why did you say this to her then?

1364
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,359
Was she like frugal? She would ask you

1365
01:04:37,359 --> 01:04:40,799
not to spend. No, it isn't that. I mean

1366
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:44,480
it's natural for a parent you know if

1367
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,720
you see something that's quite

1368
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,960
extraordinary quite expensive lavish

1369
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,280
call it what you may it's normal

1370
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:56,599
parental reaction to ask the child you

1371
01:04:56,599 --> 01:04:59,520
know why you spending money or whatever

1372
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,359
so I mean I'm just telling you I made a

1373
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:04,400
joke out of it but I was very proud that

1374
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,760
that was money I earned you know it

1375
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:11,440
wasn't money I inherited it. Tell me one

1376
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,079
lesson you learned from your mom.

1377
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:16,680
Oh, I've learned many

1378
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:19,160
lessons from my

1379
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:25,799
mom. Don't waste time and life arguing.

1380
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:30,400
It's not worth it.

1381
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,400
Use your time productively. Think

1382
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,079
positively.

1383
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:35,960
Don't keep arguing with people unless

1384
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:38,920
it's a matter that's going to get you

1385
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:43,440
somewhere. And which argument gets you

1386
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,599
anywhere. And what did you learn from

1387
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:47,440
your father? Give me one lesson.

1388
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:51,960
Something that you can't forget.

1389
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,960
Hard work and an ability to read a

1390
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:58,400
balance sheet. Company balance sheet.

1391
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,760
He was really good at it. Right. That's

1392
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,359
what it's written about him. Super

1393
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:03,359
little at it. Do you miss your I don't

1394
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:06,880
think I'd be I'd be as good but I think

1395
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,319
whatever I learned from him was good

1396
01:06:09,319 --> 01:06:13,839
enough for me to produce some excellent

1397
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:16,079
robust balance sheets in all the

1398
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:19,839
companies I ran. Do you miss him? Well,

1399
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:22,640
who doesn't miss a dad? But you know

1400
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:27,119
it's now what 1983 to 2025 is a long

1401
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:30,119
time.

1402
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,240
What do you miss about him? You can't

1403
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:34,359
keep missing somebody for 40

1404
01:06:34,359 --> 01:06:37,280
years. Life is too short for that. But

1405
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,720
do you think he would have been proud of

1406
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:41,400
you today? Well, I would hope

1407
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,480
so. Certainly not proud of me being

1408
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:48,000
called chore or

1409
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
and certainly nobody would be proud of

1410
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,760
that. Certainly no parent. I know my

1411
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,760
mother gets very agitated even today.

1412
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:57,440
She's 98 years old and every time she

1413
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,720
sees the Indian media, she's reduced to

1414
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:03,119
tears. Obviously, it hurts her more. I'm

1415
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:05,160
probably more thick skinned, more robust

1416
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:08,960
and I just ignore it. But, you know, at

1417
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:12,240
that age, my mother doesn't and it's

1418
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:15,359
very unfair what has been written, what

1419
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:17,520
has been alleged because it's complete

1420
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:20,240
nonsense. Let's walk through the case.

1421
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,480
Let's start from the point of what

1422
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:25,200
happened in Kingfisher Airlines. Okay.

1423
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,480
When did you decide that you want to

1424
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:29,319
start a kingfisher a

1425
01:07:29,319 --> 01:07:32,000
2002 2003

1426
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,559
and you just Okay. So here's a story.

1427
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:37,680
Hear me out. What I've gathered from

1428
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:40,119
reading about it

1429
01:07:40,119 --> 01:07:44,240
is one day out of blue you go to an AGM

1430
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:46,079
or like just a board meeting I think not

1431
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:48,880
AGM it was a board meeting where you

1432
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:52,160
announced that on my son's birthday we

1433
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:55,680
are going to launch Kingfisher Airlines

1434
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:57,599
your CFO was not happy about it but you

1435
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:00,440
still pursued and you want to do it this

1436
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:04,960
was the this is what is reported

1437
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:08,079
What was the reality? Tell me the truth.

1438
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:11,599
The truth is that Damana brothers from

1439
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:15,400
Bombay. Mhm.

1440
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:19,040
Who previously had Damana Airlines M

1441
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:21,799
came and made a presentation to my

1442
01:08:21,799 --> 01:08:23,960
CFO Ravin

1443
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:27,759
Aruni saying the time is ripe to start

1444
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:30,520
an airline now.

1445
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:34,440
Okay. Ravender had discussions with

1446
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:37,199
them came to me and said would you like

1447
01:08:37,199 --> 01:08:40,600
to look at this proposal? I said

1448
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:43,239
yes. We looked at

1449
01:08:43,239 --> 01:08:48,120
it and finally we decided yes it is

1450
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:52,239
opportune so let's go for it. Okay.

1451
01:08:52,239 --> 01:08:54,640
That's how the idea of an airline was

1452
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:57,640
bomb

1453
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:01,359
and then you didn't take anyone in

1454
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:04,040
confidence. You were just hey out of

1455
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:06,480
nowhere I think we are alcohol business

1456
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:09,279
now we want an airline business.

1457
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:13,080
No there's nothing wrong in

1458
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:15,600
diversification. The UB group has had a

1459
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,000
history even during my father's time of

1460
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,480
operating food processing companies.

1461
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:22,679
petrochemical companies,

1462
01:09:22,679 --> 01:09:26,400
electromechanical companies. So I mean

1463
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,719
diversity was nothing new to us. So your

1464
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:30,799
initial plan to launch an airline was

1465
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:33,120
7th May 2005 but you ended up launching

1466
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:36,880
on 9th May 2005 right and then this

1467
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,640
whole business of launch on son's

1468
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,759
birthday as a birthday gift and all is

1469
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:44,120
complete baloney. All

1470
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:46,400
right. I think my son would be

1471
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:47,839
embarrassed and I would be equally

1472
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:49,719
embarrassed to say I'm starting an

1473
01:09:49,719 --> 01:09:52,400
airline. All right. As an 18th birthday

1474
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:55,280
gift. Complete nonsense. All right. But

1475
01:09:55,280 --> 01:10:00,000
okay. Once again, media narratives are

1476
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,400
best ignored.

1477
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,280
A fullblown professional management team

1478
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:10,960
was in position before the airline even

1479
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:13,920
started before the first plane arrived.

1480
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:18,159
Okay. The CEO and the director of

1481
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:22,280
engineering were both hired from the US.

1482
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:27,320
Okay. And the airline was launched.

1483
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,280
There's a lot of narrative about

1484
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,080
Kingfish

1485
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:33,199
Airlines. There's a lot of narrative

1486
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:35,440
about mismanagement.

1487
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:38,679
A lot of narrative about the Dean

1488
01:10:38,679 --> 01:10:40,880
acquisition. All sorts of things. Let's

1489
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,960
pick one by one. What was the first

1490
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,800
vision of King Visher Airlines when you

1491
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,679
were starting in 2005? To produce the

1492
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:51,199
best flying experience that India had

1493
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:53,679
ever seen.

1494
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:56,400
Make it a premium experience. totally a

1495
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,719
premium experience number one terms of

1496
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:01,920
passenger comfort, safety, number two to

1497
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,000
connect places in India that had never

1498
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,040
ever been connected before and that it

1499
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:10,800
was a really serious part of the growing

1500
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,640
infrastructural needs of the country.

1501
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:18,400
Hm. But I was watching one documentary

1502
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,360
about you

1503
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:23,840
and I think the person who you got to

1504
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:28,080
lead was Alex. Yeah. Will Cox. Yeah. So

1505
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:29,880
Alex said

1506
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:32,719
that you convinced him that you want to

1507
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:35,600
build a lowc cost carrier but it was not

1508
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:38,080
like that. And in your own words, if

1509
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:39,360
you're giving a vision that I want to

1510
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:41,600
build a premium experience, why did you

1511
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,920
get a CEO or like a president, I don't

1512
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,280
know what was his position, but somebody

1513
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:48,120
to lead by telling him

1514
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:52,400
that you want to build a lowc cost

1515
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,560
carrier. That is your own

1516
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:59,560
misinformation.

1517
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,600
He said it somewhere. I'm not I'm just

1518
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:04,239
quoting him. Fair enough. I haven't seen

1519
01:12:04,239 --> 01:12:07,760
it, but I'll respond.

1520
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:12,199
Kingfisher Airlines started off as a

1521
01:12:12,199 --> 01:12:15,560
singleass airline, low

1522
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:18,679
cost but with a

1523
01:12:18,679 --> 01:12:21,400
difference. It had inflight

1524
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:25,199
entertainment and it offered meals.

1525
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:28,080
Everything else that's applicable to a

1526
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:30,080
lowcost airline was applied to King

1527
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,880
Fisher as well. commonality of fleet,

1528
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:35,840
commonality of training, the whole lot.

1529
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:38,000
I mean there's a whole set of rules.

1530
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,560
What is a lowcost carrier? What is a

1531
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:43,679
full service carrier? Right? And that

1532
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:45,920
even descends down to intricacies such

1533
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:48,320
as the type of reservation system,

1534
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,159
flight planning system you use and all

1535
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:52,320
the rest of it. So Kingfisher had all

1536
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:55,760
the lowcost attributes. Okay. The only

1537
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:58,960
product plus was inflight entertainment

1538
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:02,239
for the first time ever in India and

1539
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:03,480
good

1540
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:07,920
food. So to me the logic from my

1541
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:10,840
marketing experience was Indians love

1542
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,880
entertainment therefore the inflight

1543
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:15,120
entertainment system and Indians love

1544
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:20,640
food. M so good food right and then of

1545
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:23,600
course okay service quality whether

1546
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,440
whether you're a low cost or a full

1547
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,760
service I mean you'd like a nice well

1548
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:31,199
trained polite set of crew and we spent

1549
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:33,880
a lot of time and energy on

1550
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:36,120
that

1551
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:39,159
then when we saw the market

1552
01:13:39,159 --> 01:13:42,800
evolve we added king fisher first which

1553
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,000
is basically the business

1554
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,640
class.

1555
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:51,040
Why? Because the market demanded that on

1556
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:51,800
certain

1557
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,239
routes, right? There's certain people

1558
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:57,120
who would not fly King Fisher because we

1559
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,960
didn't have a front cabin or a business

1560
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:03,920
class who would always fly jet. Okay?

1561
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:05,920
Because Jet had two class, business

1562
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:08,880
class and economy class, right?

1563
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:12,280
And now just to prove my

1564
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:16,400
point, Indigo is often referred to as

1565
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,880
the most successful lowcost carrier in

1566
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:21,520
the world and certainly the largest lowc

1567
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:23,199
cost carrier in India. What's Indigo

1568
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:25,840
doing now? Installing a business class.

1569
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:27,360
Right.

1570
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:31,600
Yeah. So it's not such a dumb idea.

1571
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,239
Right.

1572
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:37,040
So it worked in your favor initially.

1573
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:40,760
Yes. So by and by 2008 you were the

1574
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:44,000
biggest airline in the country having a

1575
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,080
27% market share. Yes. Right. What went

1576
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:49,920
wrong?

1577
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,920
If things were right, your marketing was

1578
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,159
working, you had everything right. In

1579
01:14:54,159 --> 01:14:56,080
fact before even you answer that I want

1580
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:59,920
to go to which is often talked about is

1581
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:02,239
your training of cabin crew. What was

1582
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:04,800
the idea behind that? you selected

1583
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,520
certain people based on how they look or

1584
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:09,120
how they're going to be presented. Yeah.

1585
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,400
Well, you know, I mean, at the end of

1586
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:14,440
the day, you have you have very

1587
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:17,239
good-looking ladies

1588
01:15:17,239 --> 01:15:21,320
who sadly can't speak very

1589
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:23,679
well. Now, what is one of the key

1590
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:26,400
attributes of a cabin crew?

1591
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,320
Communication.

1592
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,760
I mean you may look

1593
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:33,600
good but if you can't communicate with

1594
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:34,679
the

1595
01:15:34,679 --> 01:15:37,520
passenger that doesn't serve the purpose

1596
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,760
the kind of service standards that I set

1597
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:42,719
for the airline and my service standards

1598
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:47,159
were unique they included in business

1599
01:15:47,159 --> 01:15:48,760
class

1600
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:51,000
the

1601
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,600
aeroses cleaning the reading glasses and

1602
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:57,440
spectacles of our customers. We call

1603
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:58,280
them

1604
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:00,040
guests,

1605
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:02,800
right? So there were little things that

1606
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:05,199
made a vast difference in the customer

1607
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:07,440
experience. Tell me two more thing. Two,

1608
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:10,159
two, three more things. This is one.

1609
01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:12,360
Okay. Secondly, the food was second to

1610
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:14,280
none.

1611
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:16,719
Right. I mean the quality of the seats

1612
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:18,480
themselves, the recline and all the rest

1613
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:21,600
of it, what they call the seat pitch,

1614
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:24,880
it's second to none. So there was so

1615
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:28,199
many little attributes. We

1616
01:16:28,199 --> 01:16:29,960
called

1617
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:33,440
customers not passengers but guests.

1618
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:36,239
Many airlines have copied us since but

1619
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:38,080
they were the little little things that

1620
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:40,800
made a difference. I was very focused on

1621
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,440
the service delivery excellence of King

1622
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:46,080
Krishna. You can go further because you

1623
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:47,760
don't know this. You can't ask me the

1624
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:51,120
question. So let me tell you. Yeah. In

1625
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,080
the first one

1626
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:55,920
year, the airport manager at every

1627
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:59,120
single airport in India had to send me

1628
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:01,560
on my personal mobile and

1629
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:04,040
SMS the flight

1630
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:07,440
number, the schedule time of departure

1631
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:11,040
and the actual departure time.

1632
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:13,840
So every night before I went to bed

1633
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:16,560
which was rather late I used to look at

1634
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:18,719
my phone every single flight of King

1635
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:21,280
Fisher of that day I used to monitor

1636
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,920
personally the on-time performance. You

1637
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:27,679
were so detailed focused. You were so

1638
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:30,960
because the the service industry in the

1639
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,760
airline industry

1640
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:36,640
requires focus requires detailed focus.

1641
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:40,480
So agreed then it worked in your favor

1642
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:43,840
till 2008. What happened then? Simple.

1643
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:46,320
You ever heard of Lemon Brothers? Yeah.

1644
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,000
You ever heard of the global financial

1645
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,640
crisis,

1646
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:53,600
right? Did it not impact India?

1647
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:55,199
Of course it did. The whole aviation

1648
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:57,760
sector was forget aviation. Every sector

1649
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:59,199
every sector was. Yeah. The money

1650
01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:00,719
stopped. It got dry. The value of the

1651
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:04,360
Indian rupee. So I went to Shri Pranab

1652
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:07,640
Mukhuji then finance minister of

1653
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:10,239
India having grown up in Kolkata. I

1654
01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:14,679
speak fairly decent Bengali and I

1655
01:18:14,679 --> 01:18:17,400
said I'm a

1656
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:21,920
problem king Airlines downsize

1657
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:22,760
which

1658
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:26,840
means I have to downsize this

1659
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:31,280
a cut number of aircraft. I have to lay

1660
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:34,960
off employees. M right because I can't

1661
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:39,080
afford to operate under these depressed

1662
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:40,760
economic

1663
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:42,840
circumstances. He said

1664
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:46,560
no at this time connectivity is

1665
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:50,719
important. Yeah. The jobs and employment

1666
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:52,800
are important particularly because you

1667
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:56,320
know typically in an airline they're not

1668
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,960
blue collar workers. Huh? M these are

1669
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:03,040
not like work men. Yeah. And the the

1670
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:05,080
boys and girls who work in an

1671
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:07,480
airline can't be classified as blue

1672
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:10,640
collar. And he said I don't want them to

1673
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:12,040
lose their

1674
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:15,679
jobs. So you continue banks will support

1675
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:19,760
you. That is how it all started.

1676
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:23,600
I was told not to downsize King Fisher

1677
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:24,520
at that

1678
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:29,800
time and yes the banks did support. All

1679
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:32,320
right. Now

1680
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:35,840
what happened then? Lot of well you tell

1681
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:38,000
me the narrative. I'll tell you the

1682
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,159
truth. You tell me the narrative. Then

1683
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:43,480
there was a consortium formed of 17

1684
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:47,679
banks and the loan was given to you via

1685
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:51,120
SBI right? Was that the first or IDBI

1686
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,280
was first?

1687
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:59,239
See this is where people are not aware.

1688
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:04,199
I acquired Eden

1689
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:08,960
which everybody says was a big mistake.

1690
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:12,400
Yeah. What? In $137 million or something

1691
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,120
like that.

1692
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:17,800
Everybody says you overpaid for it. In

1693
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:22,480
the world of

1694
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:25,040
business, there's something known as

1695
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:28,880
consolidation, industry

1696
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:31,800
consolidation. There is something known

1697
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:37,000
as eliminate the disruptor. Okay.

1698
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:41,199
Eden was famous for advertising and

1699
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:44,719
promoting one rupee tickets. Yeah.

1700
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:47,560
Clearly you could never ever

1701
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:50,800
sustain any airline business selling

1702
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,280
tickets for one

1703
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:58,480
rupee. Right. Okay. It was a bait. H

1704
01:20:58,480 --> 01:20:59,880
but that

1705
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:02,880
set certain price expectations in the

1706
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:05,600
mindset of the customers. Yeah.

1707
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:08,560
and affected not only Decker which was

1708
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:11,679
losing money but the industry as a whole

1709
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:16,600
of which King Fisher was also a part.

1710
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,280
Right?

1711
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:21,960
So at that time we looked at

1712
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:27,159
it was also Bangalore based. It had the

1713
01:21:27,159 --> 01:21:31,040
same Airbus aircraft. It had the same

1714
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:33,920
train pilots as King Fisher. So there

1715
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:35,560
was a lot of

1716
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:39,560
engineering compatibility

1717
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:43,239
plus scale and

1718
01:21:43,239 --> 01:21:47,480
size with a merger of Kingfisher and

1719
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:49,880
Deka eliminate the

1720
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:52,639
disruptor and consolidate the industry

1721
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:55,280
and Kingfisher Airlines. That was the

1722
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:57,719
logic of buying

1723
01:21:57,719 --> 01:21:59,800
Dean, not

1724
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:02,120
this much

1725
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:05,639
touted logic of I was desperate to fly

1726
01:22:05,639 --> 01:22:08,239
overseas. I needed to get past that

1727
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:12,880
5-year hurdle. Complete nonsense. Now,

1728
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:15,600
why should I shout from the rooftops

1729
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:20,239
trying to trying to clarify this? But if

1730
01:22:20,239 --> 01:22:23,280
you talk to anybody about elimination of

1731
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:26,040
a disruptor and consolidation of

1732
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:28,000
industry, it'll start make and

1733
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,480
commonality of equipment, it'll start

1734
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:32,480
making business sense. But if your

1735
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:35,080
philosophy was to make a premium

1736
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:38,159
airline, why would you buy something

1737
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:40,000
which stands for lowc cost carrier,

1738
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,600
which stands for something cheap, which

1739
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,760
stands for one rupee ticket? Because the

1740
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:46,480
customers would be completely different.

1741
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:48,560
The only obvious sense which anybody

1742
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:51,440
could make it out from it was if you are

1743
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,920
going for a different vision you are

1744
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:56,400
probably going out because the 5year

1745
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:59,920
window which you wanted uh which you

1746
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,520
wanted to bounce right probably yeah of

1747
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:04,400
course like that was the logic like I to

1748
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,000
clarify to tell people who don't know

1749
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,159
about it the logic that people talk

1750
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:10,560
about is if an Indian airline wanted to

1751
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,800
fly overseas they should have operated

1752
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,960
in India for at least 5 years before

1753
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:17,440
getting the license to operate air and

1754
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:19,199
you didn't have that and that's why you

1755
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:22,080
bought air deck in so that you could

1756
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,880
start flying overseas and you paid an

1757
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,880
absurd amount of price for it that's

1758
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:29,040
what people say so who is the people

1759
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:31,520
that you're quoting everybody like all

1760
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,199
the things that I've read all the all

1761
01:23:33,199 --> 01:23:35,840
the media like media right yeah like the

1762
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,840
legacy media right the legacy media the

1763
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:41,040
people who are responsible for giving us

1764
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:43,040
the information I mean that's what as a

1765
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:44,080
citizen that's where I get my

1766
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:45,520
information from correct and at least

1767
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,960
from the ones who I really respect. So I

1768
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:52,199
don't think anybody at UB group was that

1769
01:23:52,199 --> 01:23:57,080
dumb with a lack of business

1770
01:23:57,080 --> 01:24:00,040
understanding to buy an

1771
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:02,800
airline, an operating airline just to be

1772
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:06,320
able to fly overseas.

1773
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:08,920
I'm telling you the logic

1774
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:11,719
was consolidation of the

1775
01:24:11,719 --> 01:24:14,080
industry given the commonality of

1776
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:16,719
equipment.

1777
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:20,600
I referred a little

1778
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:23,440
earlier to the installation of a front

1779
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:26,400
cabin or business class which we called

1780
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:29,560
king first which Indigo are doing even

1781
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:32,080
now. There are certain routes in India

1782
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:34,159
that demand

1783
01:24:34,159 --> 01:24:36,800
right a front cabin where there are

1784
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:39,840
people who will only fly business class

1785
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:43,159
fair but the bulk of

1786
01:24:43,159 --> 01:24:47,000
India people want a single class

1787
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,280
product Dean fitted that bill

1788
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,239
fantastically

1789
01:24:51,239 --> 01:24:55,840
right we opened up more routes than had

1790
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:58,560
ever been opened before or available for

1791
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,400
air connectivity

1792
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:01,600
That was one of the biggest

1793
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:04,320
contributions we made to the Indian

1794
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:07,480
aviation sector and economy.

1795
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:11,239
Right. Dean also played a part in

1796
01:25:11,239 --> 01:25:14,040
that.

1797
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:17,280
So, Kingfisher's sad failure

1798
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,040
subsequently had nothing to do with

1799
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:21,760
Dean. Okay. Nothing to do with how much

1800
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:23,560
we paid for

1801
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:26,880
Dean. Right. Got it. Those were totally

1802
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:29,800
separate set of reasons.

1803
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:32,400
Right. But business reasons. Here's a

1804
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,719
question on it. So I get the idea that

1805
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:36,880
you wanted to service more routes. You

1806
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:38,320
wanted to consolidate. That was a

1807
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:40,480
business decision. You saw that hey I

1808
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,840
want to build a premium airline but

1809
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:43,760
there's a bulk of India who cares about

1810
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:46,320
the price and you wanted to contribute

1811
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:49,080
to make sure that I want to make sure

1812
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:54,520
that India gets to fly anywhere and

1813
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:57,040
everywhere through the price point which

1814
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:59,120
air deckin provides and if I could be

1815
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:01,440
the one to consolidate it and I could be

1816
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:03,280
the one to actually eliminate the

1817
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:04,800
disruptor I should do it. Business

1818
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,520
decision brilliant. Do you think then

1819
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,920
the wrong decision was to rebrand it to

1820
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,320
King Fisher Red? Because you can't start

1821
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:14,679
operating one Deckan and one King

1822
01:26:14,679 --> 01:26:17,199
Fisher. So we just called it King Fisher

1823
01:26:17,199 --> 01:26:19,679
Red. I mean rebranding is is is common

1824
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:21,000
in the world. Take

1825
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,760
Coca-Cola, right? There's Coke, there's

1826
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:27,400
Coke Zero, there's Diet Coke. It's all

1827
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:31,120
Coke, right? So a multibrand strategy is

1828
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:33,600
no rocket science. Yeah. But then the

1829
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,600
philosophy of air decken was low cost

1830
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,960
and in kingfisher red. So kingfisher

1831
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:41,360
stood for premium. Kingfisher red stood

1832
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:44,719
for low cost. It was differentiated king

1833
01:26:44,719 --> 01:26:45,719
fisher

1834
01:26:45,719 --> 01:26:50,320
first and king fisher red. Okay. Right.

1835
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:52,320
You tell me something. What's the

1836
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:55,480
difference between coke zero and dad

1837
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:58,239
coke? Tell me. Just two names I don't

1838
01:26:58,239 --> 01:27:00,159
know. Yeah fine. What's the philosophy

1839
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:02,880
behind it? You don't know. So how can

1840
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:05,120
all these commentators be commenting on

1841
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:07,480
king pusher first and king pusher

1842
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:10,560
red? You know the the trouble in India

1843
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:13,679
is that there are too many commentators

1844
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:16,560
who don't understand the facts and of

1845
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,840
course the media plays to the

1846
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:21,480
gallery and that's how

1847
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:25,920
disinformation gets spread

1848
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:28,440
wide and

1849
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:31,840
then you stated somewhere again the

1850
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:36,199
commentators I'm quoting that I want

1851
01:27:36,199 --> 01:27:39,600
to if I've put in a name king fisher on

1852
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,360
an airline no matter even if it's low

1853
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:45,360
cost I want to provide all the services

1854
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:46,800
you started providing all the services

1855
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:48,320
you started providing catering you

1856
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:49,600
started providing everything in a lowc

1857
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:52,320
cost carrier didn't you I began by

1858
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,800
saying that king fisher started off with

1859
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:56,880
all the attributes of a lowc cost

1860
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:59,520
carrier which is single class

1861
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:03,600
standard fleet etc etc etc but I said

1862
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:05,440
the only differentiator was inflight

1863
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:07,460
entertainment and food

1864
01:28:07,460 --> 01:28:08,639
[Music]

1865
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:11,040
I mean just because I gave food didn't

1866
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:14,320
make it a full service carrier. I mean

1867
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:17,199
you want shall I give you examples?

1868
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:20,480
Yeah. You go on any lowc cost carrier

1869
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,639
here in Europe. All right. Do they

1870
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:25,440
starve you or do they feed you? But you

1871
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:28,000
have to pay for it. No. All of them. I

1872
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,840
don't know. A few of them. The ones I

1873
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:33,520
Okay. So there are exceptions. Okay.

1874
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:35,360
But that was the business like that's

1875
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:36,719
what everybody talks about, right? You

1876
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:38,159
know that's the problem. Lack of

1877
01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:41,400
information and knowledge and more

1878
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:44,239
importantly no domain knowledge of the

1879
01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:48,880
aviation industry leads to all sorts of

1880
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:51,440
speculation that makes no sense. So you

1881
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:53,320
tell us

1882
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:55,840
that does it make business sense to

1883
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:58,080
provide food and inflight entertainment

1884
01:28:58,080 --> 01:28:59,679
in a lowc cost carrier where people

1885
01:28:59,679 --> 01:29:02,480
don't care about it. Wait, our belief

1886
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:04,639
was Indians love food and love

1887
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:06,159
entertainment.

1888
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:08,159
That was for King Fisher first, but not

1889
01:29:08,159 --> 01:29:09,920
for Kingfisher Red. King Fisher Red

1890
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:11,760
stands for low. An inflight

1891
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:13,760
entertainment system doesn't cost you

1892
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:16,960
money to operate every day

1893
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:19,360
but still cost you a lot of money which

1894
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,120
eventually will bleed your balance

1895
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:24,800
sheet. Really? I'm asking you.

1896
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,560
Not in our opinion. Do you think that

1897
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,880
was the wrong decision? What? which is

1898
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:32,159
provided. Yeah. After acquiring deck

1899
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:35,440
giving all the services of a full full

1900
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:36,440
service

1901
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:39,880
carrier in a lowc cost

1902
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:42,960
carrier the flow the the full service

1903
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:45,199
carrier part of it was very distinct

1904
01:29:45,199 --> 01:29:50,000
from the so-called lowcost carrier. Uh

1905
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,880
at the end of the day, however you may

1906
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:57,920
refer to these business models. Mhm. Uh

1907
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:00,920
it's all about the

1908
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:03,920
price your customers are willing to pay

1909
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:06,080
and whether you can fill your plans.

1910
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:10,040
Simple. So all models are

1911
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:12,280
academic and

1912
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:15,679
theoretical that really are irrelevant.

1913
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:17,960
But your critiques say

1914
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:20,480
that you were competing against other

1915
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:23,840
lowc cost carriers like like at that

1916
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:26,000
time was it I think Indigo started at

1917
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,440
that time and Spice started at that

1918
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:31,520
time. I think Spice Spice was there on

1919
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:33,840
and off. Yeah. But more often than not,

1920
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:35,120
so you were competing with lowc cost

1921
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:37,360
carriers with their pricing, but you

1922
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:38,719
were providing something extra and

1923
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:40,159
that's why your business model was

1924
01:30:40,159 --> 01:30:42,159
bleeding more money than them and you

1925
01:30:42,159 --> 01:30:44,639
expected that this will turn into loyal

1926
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:46,400
customers. But the moment you increase

1927
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:48,960
price, people would not fly your CL your

1928
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:51,520
flights. Was it was it true? That's what

1929
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,199
the critics say. They are all aviation

1930
01:30:53,199 --> 01:30:57,199
experts. I have nothing to say.

1931
01:30:57,199 --> 01:30:58,800
So where was the problem then? If this

1932
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,159
was not the problem, then what happened?

1933
01:31:00,159 --> 01:31:01,880
The problem was the

1934
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:04,400
government. The problem was fairly and

1935
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:07,199
squarely the government. And I, you

1936
01:31:07,199 --> 01:31:09,760
know, they've made a lot of political

1937
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:11,760
hay out of this. When I used to write to

1938
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:14,480
Prime Minister Manm Singh,

1939
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:17,840
uh when I used to write uh to to to the

1940
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:20,719
civil aviation

1941
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:25,199
ministers, ministers of

1942
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:29,600
finance, the cost of crude,

1943
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:33,600
international crude went to $140 a

1944
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:36,600
barrel.

1945
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:40,840
The price of aviation turbine fuel in

1946
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:44,159
India was directly related to the cost

1947
01:31:44,159 --> 01:31:47,760
of international crude

1948
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:51,280
oil. So you can see that from an average

1949
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:53,480
of about $60 a

1950
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:56,120
barrel, crude oil went to

1951
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:58,040
$140 a

1952
01:31:58,040 --> 01:32:02,159
barrel with the resultant and equivalent

1953
01:32:02,159 --> 01:32:03,679
increase in the price of aviation

1954
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:07,520
turbine fuel. M the state governments

1955
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:11,840
levied and ad valorum sales tax on

1956
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:15,480
aviation turbine fuel. So you can

1957
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:18,880
yourself now begin to imagine the

1958
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:21,320
financial impact on the

1959
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:25,360
airline operating where fuel costs are

1960
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:28,719
the single largest component of cost. So

1961
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:29,719
I

1962
01:32:29,719 --> 01:32:33,280
pleaded I said look please give aviation

1963
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:37,600
termine fuel declared good status so

1964
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:40,880
that it attracts central sales tax and

1965
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:43,800
not this punitive

1966
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:47,280
advalorum state sales tax right because

1967
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:52,040
the states are making windfall profits

1968
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:55,639
anyway that the government did not do

1969
01:32:55,639 --> 01:32:57,840
okay aviation

1970
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:00,480
is regarded as a capital intensive

1971
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:02,080
industry,

1972
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:04,239
right? It's acknowledged as such

1973
01:33:04,239 --> 01:33:07,239
worldwide,

1974
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:11,560
right? They would not permit foreign

1975
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:14,000
investment. It was sad that only 6

1976
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,360
months after King Airlines shut, right,

1977
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:19,520
that they permitted Ajiad to invest in

1978
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:23,520
jet. I had already reached agreement

1979
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:26,239
with the CEO of Edihad in Geneva for

1980
01:33:26,239 --> 01:33:28,480
them to invest in King Fisher which

1981
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:30,719
government did not permit. So we could

1982
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:33,600
not capitalize the airline through a

1983
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:35,840
foreign investor either. Why didn't they

1984
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:38,880
allow? They should ask government.

1985
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:40,239
Right?

1986
01:33:40,239 --> 01:33:42,199
So my point

1987
01:33:42,199 --> 01:33:46,920
is the economy, the

1988
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:49,440
circumstances, the government policy

1989
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:51,159
then

1990
01:33:51,159 --> 01:33:54,719
existing all conspired to create a

1991
01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:58,080
perfect storm through which King Fisher

1992
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:00,639
could not survive. I mean that's a sad

1993
01:34:00,639 --> 01:34:04,639
part of it. If you talk about Kingfisher

1994
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:05,960
the

1995
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:09,120
concept and UB group's diversification

1996
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:13,400
into aviation, I'll answer it in one

1997
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:17,199
sentence. The two biggest orders for

1998
01:34:17,199 --> 01:34:20,719
aircraft in the world today are Air

1999
01:34:20,719 --> 01:34:23,400
India and Indigo, both Indian

2000
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:26,560
carriers. The fastest growing aviation

2001
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:30,880
market in the world today is India.

2002
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:34,040
Now if you yourself acknowledge that in

2003
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:36,719
2008 Kingfisher was the largest airline

2004
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:41,000
with a 27% market share. Had

2005
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,960
events not conspired against

2006
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:46,600
us.

2007
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:49,360
Right? You can imagine where King Fer

2008
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:52,159
could potentially have been today.

2009
01:34:52,159 --> 01:34:55,800
But sadly not all businesses work out.

2010
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:59,120
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.

2011
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:03,840
While this like 2008 turmoil happened

2012
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:05,760
and you had your own challenges with

2013
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:08,000
King Fisher, but there were good things

2014
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,120
in your life which are happening as

2015
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:12,040
well. Mhm. One of them being

2016
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:17,520
sports. So you you bought IPL team RCB

2017
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:19,600
Royal Challenges Bangalore. How did that

2018
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:21,840
happen? When did this idea come to you?

2019
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:24,159
Were you approached? You approached what

2020
01:35:24,159 --> 01:35:25,679
was it? Tell me everything about it.

2021
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:30,760
Well, I think I've already explained to

2022
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:33,679
you the concept behind building a

2023
01:35:33,679 --> 01:35:37,040
personality for a brand. Mhm. About

2024
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:40,040
communicating

2025
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:43,600
um marketing

2026
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,159
u

2027
01:35:45,159 --> 01:35:48,400
ethos via sporting events, via music

2028
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:50,400
events

2029
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:52,800
um and various other forms that would be

2030
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:56,520
attractive to youngsters.

2031
01:35:57,199 --> 01:35:59,520
I had just acquired Shawless and one of

2032
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:01,360
the biggest brands that I acquired was

2033
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:04,120
Royal Challenge

2034
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:07,600
Whiskey and I was thinking of ways and

2035
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:10,560
means of now taking Royal Challenge

2036
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:13,840
whiskey to the next level which required

2037
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:16,360
a lot of marketing

2038
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:19,080
innovation

2039
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:23,159
thinking and at the time the IPL was

2040
01:36:23,159 --> 01:36:27,920
conceived I was actually sitting on the

2041
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:32,239
um BCCI committee as a representative of

2042
01:36:32,239 --> 01:36:34,199
the Karnataka State Cricket

2043
01:36:34,199 --> 01:36:36,560
Association and I was very impressed

2044
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:40,960
with the pitch that Lalit Modi made to

2045
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:43,520
the BCCI committee about this league.

2046
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:45,480
Mhm. And of

2047
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:49,960
course uh he was working through

2048
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:54,000
um jumping through the hoops. BCCI was

2049
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,560
quite bureaucratic at that time. But

2050
01:36:57,560 --> 01:36:59,760
nevertheless, he called me one day and

2051
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:02,159
said, "Okay, fine. We're ready to go.

2052
01:37:02,159 --> 01:37:04,159
Teams are going to be auctioned. Are you

2053
01:37:04,159 --> 01:37:06,639
going to buy?" And I thought to myself,

2054
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:09,280
I said, "Wow, in a country where cricket

2055
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:10,199
is a

2056
01:37:10,199 --> 01:37:14,119
religion, what better platform can I

2057
01:37:14,119 --> 01:37:17,440
have to promote my brands than through

2058
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:20,880
an IPL franchise?"

2059
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:24,159
And I got greedy. I wanted one for King

2060
01:37:24,159 --> 01:37:28,000
Fisher. M and one for Royal Challenge,

2061
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,560
my whiskey brand. Okay. He said, "No,

2062
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:32,679
you cannot possibly have

2063
01:37:32,679 --> 01:37:35,320
two. You can only have

2064
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:39,080
one." Anyway, bidding time

2065
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:41,080
came

2066
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:44,639
and I think I was pretty excited about

2067
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:48,480
having an IPL team to promote one of my

2068
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:50,960
brands.

2069
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:55,360
And so I bid for three franchises. Okay.

2070
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:58,080
I lost Mumbai by a very small amount of

2071
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:01,119
money. But then that's not surprising

2072
01:38:01,119 --> 01:38:05,360
that Aman's got it. But anyway, I wound

2073
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:08,480
up being the highest bidder for three

2074
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:11,840
and I had to choose one. So I obviously

2075
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,320
chose

2076
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:17,040
Bangalore and it then was natural that

2077
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:20,239
it would be Royal Challengers Bangalore

2078
01:38:20,239 --> 01:38:22,800
because the whiskey was Royal Challenge

2079
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:26,560
and that's how RCB was born. But it was

2080
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:29,840
not a business it was not for the love

2081
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:32,080
of cricket. It was more like a business

2082
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:34,159
decision that it will help my brands or

2083
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:36,560
was it both? This is it. The media

2084
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:37,960
narrative will

2085
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:42,480
be well vanity project. Vijay Mala loves

2086
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:44,639
cricket. He wanted to buy his own team.

2087
01:38:44,639 --> 01:38:45,800
Yeah.

2088
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:48,520
Flamboyance. The usual narrative about

2089
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:52,320
me. But the sole purpose always was

2090
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:54,920
promotion of the Royal Challenge whiskey

2091
01:38:54,920 --> 01:38:57,480
brand. So it was very much

2092
01:38:57,480 --> 01:38:59,440
businessdriven and that's why it was

2093
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:01,520
called Royal Challengers. But did it

2094
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:03,679
help after that? The whiskey sales went

2095
01:39:03,679 --> 01:39:05,600
up massively.

2096
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:08,880
massively and of course quite apart from

2097
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:11,920
it doing its job to promote the whiskey

2098
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:16,159
brand the IPL franchise model itself as

2099
01:39:16,159 --> 01:39:19,360
explained in great detail by Lalith

2100
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:22,480
um and which is true now is that the

2101
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:26,320
revenues the media revenues is so high

2102
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:28,960
the payment of the franchise fee over 10

2103
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:31,280
years is over so now there's a

2104
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:34,159
significant net profit for every

2105
01:39:34,159 --> 01:39:36,800
franchisee It's like a very profitable

2106
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:40,239
running independent business. So, so

2107
01:39:40,239 --> 01:39:42,719
much so for it being a vanity project.

2108
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:45,119
How much did you buy it for? I think

2109
01:39:45,119 --> 01:39:48,480
$112 million is what I bid. And that

2110
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:50,880
time it would be like 6 700 crores or

2111
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:52,719
more than Yeah, I think but but Lit was

2112
01:39:52,719 --> 01:39:55,560
clever. He everything was denominated in

2113
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:58,960
dollars. The bid price was okay. I think

2114
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:02,400
112 million which of course people boked

2115
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:04,239
at at that time but you know in

2116
01:40:04,239 --> 01:40:05,920
hindsight if you look at it and do the

2117
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:08,159
math it was a top class investment. I

2118
01:40:08,159 --> 01:40:10,000
mean look at what the teams are worth

2119
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,239
today. Yeah. I mean there was a billion

2120
01:40:12,239 --> 01:40:14,880
dollars. You know one thing which was

2121
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:17,760
exciting in your pitch in your bid for

2122
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:22,639
RCB was Virat Kohli. Virat Kohli under

2123
01:40:22,639 --> 01:40:27,040
19 you bid for him and you if I'm not

2124
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:28,639
wrong you got it for like 20 lakh

2125
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:31,440
something correct why did you pick Virat

2126
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:34,320
at such a young age well you know

2127
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:37,320
obviously there was the young

2128
01:40:37,320 --> 01:40:42,520
creditors and it was draw by lots

2129
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:45,840
right and finally I got lucky so I got

2130
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:51,119
to pick and I immediately went for Vart

2131
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:54,600
you know, I mean, I looked just I

2132
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:59,199
think shortly before the actual um

2133
01:40:59,199 --> 01:41:01,000
selection

2134
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,600
process there, they were playing the

2135
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:06,480
under9 World Cup and I was very

2136
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:09,199
impressed and so I picked him and you

2137
01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:11,440
know it's wonderful 18 years later he's

2138
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:13,760
still there. They were just his

2139
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:15,520
performance or were you going to see

2140
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:18,159
something? Yeah, he was a young kid at

2141
01:41:18,159 --> 01:41:20,960
that time when I got him. But you know,

2142
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:23,639
full of energy, great

2143
01:41:23,639 --> 01:41:26,239
talent and you know, one of the greatest

2144
01:41:26,239 --> 01:41:28,480
Indian cricketers ever. If you had the

2145
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:30,480
choice to pick two or three players from

2146
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:32,400
other teams for RCB today, who would you

2147
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:35,239
pick? If dreams could come

2148
01:41:35,239 --> 01:41:39,480
true, just brea.

2149
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:42,520
Yeah. if dreams

2150
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:45,880
could come

2151
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:50,400
true. Uh Surya Kumar

2152
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,560
Yadav Visha

2153
01:41:55,239 --> 01:41:58,840
Pant Rahul if I had these

2154
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:02,800
four I wouldn't need anybody else and

2155
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:05,520
definitely win the trophy.

2156
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:07,440
And do you think this year even when you

2157
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:10,960
don't have these four you would the RCB

2158
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:13,520
line trophy this year the RCB lineup is

2159
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:16,080
pretty balanced

2160
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:20,159
um top class batting lineup

2161
01:42:20,159 --> 01:42:24,440
uh a much improved bowling lineup

2162
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:28,000
um I haven't seen Bhuvar Kumar play in

2163
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,880
RCB colors yet but you know he's a top

2164
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:33,040
class bowler

2165
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:36,800
um but as a unit I can say it's a pretty

2166
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:41,600
balanced unit and now it all depends on

2167
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:44,639
onfield performance. You know this year

2168
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:48,639
the captain Rajat he's from my city he's

2169
01:42:48,639 --> 01:42:51,600
from my neighborhood. Oh like like he

2170
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:53,360
was literally like two houses away from

2171
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:55,840
my house Rajat Partidar. So this year

2172
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:59,040
even though I'm not I support Mumbai but

2173
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:02,000
this year I'm still voting for RCB and

2174
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
I'm like okay let let Rajett win the

2175
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:05,600
trophy.

2176
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:09,159
Okay. But it you know it occurs to me

2177
01:43:09,159 --> 01:43:13,040
that RCB never winning the cup has

2178
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:15,440
actually worked in the RCB favor. Do you

2179
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:17,760
think so? In what way? In cult

2180
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:20,880
following. No. Even though you guys have

2181
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:24,480
like the RCB has never won. You see that

2182
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:27,080
is because the day

2183
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:30,239
RCB was conceived

2184
01:43:30,239 --> 01:43:35,360
we have had a comprehensive program of

2185
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:37,280
fan engagement.

2186
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:39,760
Okay. Right. We've had event I mean the

2187
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:43,840
the the IPL window is 2 months but we

2188
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:46,159
have had activation program stretching

2189
01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:50,440
over all 12 months. Keep the RCB fans

2190
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:54,800
engaged. So it is once again a a

2191
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:58,080
three-cut marketing strategy and fan

2192
01:43:58,080 --> 01:44:00,800
engagement strategy which has worked.

2193
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:05,040
That's why we have such extreme loyalty

2194
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:08,159
that win or lose the chant of RCB is

2195
01:44:08,159 --> 01:44:09,920
always there. Give me an example of the

2196
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:12,000
marketing trick here. So many I mean you

2197
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,639
you watch the activations of RCB

2198
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:17,800
longevity right? You

2199
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:20,400
remember LA?

2200
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:23,600
Yeah. Remember? Yeah.

2201
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:27,040
Lao. When was this conceived?

2202
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:31,080
You don't know. Well, let me tell you.

2203
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:34,639
1996 World Cup of crickets. The

2204
01:44:34,639 --> 01:44:37,920
Kingfisher West Indies cricket team. Now

2205
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:39,800
back in

2206
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:43,920
1996 I put the Kingfisher logo on the

2207
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:48,000
West Indies not Indian cricket team.

2208
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:51,760
Okay. And because why? The personalities

2209
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:53,400
of the West Indian

2210
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:57,440
cricketers fun dancing music their

2211
01:44:57,440 --> 01:45:00,000
entire swagger that suited the

2212
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,280
Kingfisher brand. That was when the

2213
01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:06,080
jingle was conceived which lives on till

2214
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:07,520
today.

2215
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:08,679
It's

2216
01:45:08,679 --> 01:45:12,960
2025. Yeah. Wow. It was conceived before

2217
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:15,880
I was born and I still remember

2218
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:19,199
it. So you see you have been king of

2219
01:45:19,199 --> 01:45:21,199
marketing. You have done so many

2220
01:45:21,199 --> 01:45:24,480
marketing cakes, right? Was the Formula

2221
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:27,679
1 also a marketing stint for King

2222
01:45:27,679 --> 01:45:30,480
Fisher? See, I told you earlier that

2223
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:33,119
I've always had racing in my blood. I've

2224
01:45:33,119 --> 01:45:36,320
always loved racing cars.

2225
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:39,040
I was then involved with the motorsports

2226
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:42,000
clubs in India. I was chairman of the

2227
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:45,520
federation of motorsports clubs of India

2228
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:49,119
uh for many years and the job of the

2229
01:45:49,119 --> 01:45:51,119
federation was basically to promote

2230
01:45:51,119 --> 01:45:54,159
motorsports in India. Now for anybody

2231
01:45:54,159 --> 01:45:57,560
who is into motor racing the absolute

2232
01:45:57,560 --> 01:45:59,920
pinnacle of motorsport in the world is

2233
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:01,920
Formula 1.

2234
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:05,520
right now. What is Formula 1 all around?

2235
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:08,800
The image of Formula 1, big box,

2236
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:11,320
glamour,

2237
01:46:11,320 --> 01:46:14,320
uh, seriously competitive racing divided

2238
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:16,960
by hundreds of a second, full of

2239
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:20,080
excitement, etc., etc., etc. All the

2240
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:22,800
attributes I have employed in different

2241
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:24,600
ways for my

2242
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:28,360
brands and plus being a motor racing

2243
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:31,520
enthusiast, right?

2244
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:33,159
It was a

2245
01:46:33,159 --> 01:46:37,199
dream to have a team on the F1 grid. So

2246
01:46:37,199 --> 01:46:39,520
when the opportunity presented itself, I

2247
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:41,320
did

2248
01:46:41,320 --> 01:46:44,440
it right. I did

2249
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:49,600
it. Now I named it Force India. I could

2250
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:52,639
have easily named it Malaya Formula 1

2251
01:46:52,639 --> 01:46:55,280
like Williams Formula 1 for instance,

2252
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:57,440
right? But why did you keep Force One?

2253
01:46:57,440 --> 01:46:59,920
because I wanted the Indian flag to be

2254
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:00,920
on the

2255
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:04,159
grid. I wanted the world to know that

2256
01:47:04,159 --> 01:47:07,440
the team with roots in India of all

2257
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:10,600
countries was at the pinnacle of

2258
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:12,960
motorsport and that is why I called it

2259
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:16,880
force India and I had the triricolor on

2260
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:18,600
the

2261
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:22,080
car. Of course I also use the platform

2262
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:24,239
to advertise my brands. Yeah. Okay.

2263
01:47:24,239 --> 01:47:27,600
including Royal Challenge Whiskey, White

2264
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:30,080
and Mai which we owned at that time,

2265
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:34,000
King Fisher, then the airline. So the

2266
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,840
car, deliver the delivery of the car and

2267
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:38,639
all the merchandise around Formula 1 had

2268
01:47:38,639 --> 01:47:40,080
a lot of our brands on it for

2269
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:42,560
promotional purposes. But the core

2270
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:45,639
reason was to put an Indian Formula 1

2271
01:47:45,639 --> 01:47:49,520
team on the grid. But you invested quite

2272
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:51,360
a money quite a lot of money on it,

2273
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:53,119
right? Sure, I did. I mean, Formula 1's

2274
01:47:53,119 --> 01:47:54,800
not cheap. Do you think that was bad

2275
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:57,840
decision? No. In hindsight, I wouldn't

2276
01:47:57,840 --> 01:48:01,520
do anything different. Why not? Because

2277
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:04,639
why not? Because you had to sell it,

2278
01:48:04,639 --> 01:48:06,560
right? And I think a lot of accusations

2279
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:08,400
are for the same brand. Whose

2280
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:10,480
accusations about what? That you use

2281
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:12,400
King Fisher money for Formula 1 and

2282
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:14,080
nobody talks about it. Nobody talks

2283
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:15,840
about that.

2284
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:17,280
Have you spoken about it before and

2285
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:18,880
still people do? I've never Why should

2286
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:20,639
I? As I told you, I don't want to waste

2287
01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:23,239
my time

2288
01:48:23,239 --> 01:48:26,400
correcting the barrage of narratives

2289
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:29,040
coming from Legacy Media.

2290
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:31,840
But then you sold Force One. Yes. Force

2291
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:34,080
One became Racing Point. Yes. You sold

2292
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:36,960
it to Lawrence. Aston Martin Formula 1.

2293
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:39,199
Yeah. Why did you sell it to Lawrence?

2294
01:48:39,199 --> 01:48:41,440
Well, I had to at that time because of

2295
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:43,600
my worldwide freezing orders and the

2296
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:46,080
troubles that Sahara was going through

2297
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:48,239
and so on and so forth. So you know at

2298
01:48:48,239 --> 01:48:49,920
the end of the day I would have

2299
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:52,719
definitely kept it but it was not to be.

2300
01:48:52,719 --> 01:48:56,560
So fine you you move on in life but I

2301
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:58,719
had 10 years of the Indian flag on the

2302
01:48:58,719 --> 01:49:00,840
Formula 1

2303
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:03,719
grid. Talking about another marketing

2304
01:49:03,719 --> 01:49:06,159
stint because there was cricket, there

2305
01:49:06,159 --> 01:49:09,000
was Formula 1, there was Kingfisher

2306
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,760
calendar. It was so highly talked about.

2307
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:13,520
What was the story behind Kingfisher

2308
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:16,320
calendar? Atul Kazbaker came to me and

2309
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:18,159
said fine let's you know there's a

2310
01:49:18,159 --> 01:49:21,600
Pirelli calendar um why can't we create

2311
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:23,880
a similar property for kingfisher

2312
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:26,719
absolutely and so we said fine we'll

2313
01:49:26,719 --> 01:49:29,760
have the kingfisher swimsuit calendar

2314
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:32,400
uh we couldn't go sort of kind of all

2315
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:34,400
the way that Felli might have been able

2316
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:37,280
to given the social considerations in

2317
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:40,000
India and so on so forth but I think um

2318
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:43,760
we we we we produced a product that

2319
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:46,320
everybody demanded. I mean even today I

2320
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:48,280
get SMSes from people where's my

2321
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:51,199
calendar. Um so it was highly sought

2322
01:49:51,199 --> 01:49:52,800
after

2323
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:55,119
uh and once again we we had events

2324
01:49:55,119 --> 01:49:57,840
around it. We had the national uh hunt

2325
01:49:57,840 --> 01:50:00,480
for the king fisher girl and that was

2326
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:03,280
national. So we broad-based it and we

2327
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:06,560
chose models through a national hunt and

2328
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:09,600
then of course we'd have events

2329
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:13,000
uh around the calendar shooting the

2330
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:16,560
calendar and then launching the calendar

2331
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:19,440
all of which was consistent with the

2332
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:22,159
brand positioning and marketing strategy

2333
01:50:22,159 --> 01:50:24,480
of Kingfisher.

2334
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:26,520
And why do you think

2335
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:30,080
that girls who were who became or who

2336
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:32,400
landed on the calendar their career

2337
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:34,960
skyrocketed? Well, because we chose the

2338
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:37,679
right girls. I mean whether it was

2339
01:50:37,679 --> 01:50:40,840
Deepika Pardon, whether it was Katrina

2340
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:45,199
KF, I mean we we had all the the the

2341
01:50:45,199 --> 01:50:47,840
heroins and the the

2342
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:48,920
uh the

2343
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:52,400
stars uh on the calendar in their

2344
01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:54,320
younger days. But they were not stars

2345
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:56,719
back then. They became after. We picked

2346
01:50:56,719 --> 01:50:59,520
Well, we picked the right talent. Did

2347
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:01,040
you also help them after the calendar or

2348
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:03,119
it was just the engagement was only? I

2349
01:51:03,119 --> 01:51:05,600
came with the calendar and that was it.

2350
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:08,080
I did it because it was a fantastic

2351
01:51:08,080 --> 01:51:09,080
marketing

2352
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:11,600
tool. Didn't bring anything to me

2353
01:51:11,600 --> 01:51:14,280
personally, but it did wonders for the

2354
01:51:14,280 --> 01:51:17,360
brand. The same thing with the Mcdal

2355
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:22,040
marketing campaigns. Right. Okay.

2356
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:26,560
Talking about fast cars, I've always

2357
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:30,920
been passionate about cars, right?

2358
01:51:30,920 --> 01:51:35,440
And I have owned good cars, but not a

2359
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:37,960
fleet of them. In

2360
01:51:37,960 --> 01:51:41,679
India, I had a couple of Mercedes cars,

2361
01:51:41,679 --> 01:51:44,400
one Rolls-Royce, and one Mayback. That

2362
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:47,360
was it. That was all I possessed. But

2363
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:48,880
you have one of the largest car

2364
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:50,639
collections of vintage cars and stuff,

2365
01:51:50,639 --> 01:51:51,920
right? We're talking we're talking

2366
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:54,800
talking about vintage cars, which is a

2367
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:57,239
totally different ball

2368
01:51:57,239 --> 01:52:00,280
game because of

2369
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:04,840
our nationwide presence on the

2370
01:52:04,840 --> 01:52:06,920
ground. I

2371
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:09,000
told my

2372
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,800
people, "Look for vintage

2373
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:17,159
cars because they were hugely neglected.

2374
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:21,760
Many many cars went to India in the 20s

2375
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:26,560
and 30s. The Maharajas in India were

2376
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:28,520
probably the biggest

2377
01:52:28,520 --> 01:52:33,320
customers for famous cars such as

2378
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:35,679
Rolls-Royce. But these cars were in a

2379
01:52:35,679 --> 01:52:37,760
state of ruin. Given my inherent

2380
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:39,239
interest in

2381
01:52:39,239 --> 01:52:41,920
cars, I said I want to collect these and

2382
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:45,920
restore them, which I did. I mean in

2383
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:47,480
those

2384
01:52:47,480 --> 01:52:50,639
days I have bought a Rolls-Royce for

2385
01:52:50,639 --> 01:52:51,719
50,000

2386
01:52:51,719 --> 01:52:54,560
rupees with a tree growing through it in

2387
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:55,880
somebody's

2388
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:59,360
backyard deep in

2389
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:02,320
Talangalana. I have bought cars that

2390
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:05,040
have been rusted, parts missing, etc.,

2391
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:08,679
etc., etc., all of which I lovingly

2392
01:53:08,679 --> 01:53:11,760
restored over a period of time. That is

2393
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:15,440
my passion for cars and those cars still

2394
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:18,000
exist. Of course you you can't export

2395
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,760
them because that's a government of

2396
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:23,599
India policy. So they are in India.

2397
01:53:23,599 --> 01:53:26,800
Tell me tell me about the top three cars

2398
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:29,040
which you absolutely loved out of your

2399
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:31,199
collection from the vintage cars back

2400
01:53:31,199 --> 01:53:33,280
then which you owned maybe in England or

2401
01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:36,000
in India or anywhere. Yeah. No, in in in

2402
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:40,239
India, I had uh I think a 1931 PS arrow,

2403
01:53:40,239 --> 01:53:43,679
which is a fantastic American car

2404
01:53:43,679 --> 01:53:46,199
uh and which I took to

2405
01:53:46,199 --> 01:53:48,800
Singapore. I entered a Singapore to

2406
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:52,239
Malaysia rally and won it and very

2407
01:53:52,239 --> 01:53:55,199
proudly flew back on an Air India flight

2408
01:53:55,199 --> 01:53:57,920
with a big trophy in my hand. That was

2409
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:03,840
one of my favorite cars. I um have a

2410
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:07,040
Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost that was

2411
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:09,000
supposedly owned by the Nisam of

2412
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:12,880
Hyderabad with a very unique body on it.

2413
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:15,320
Uh that's a special

2414
01:54:15,320 --> 01:54:20,520
car. I um have I think a 1903

2415
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:23,280
Darak which looks more like a horsedrawn

2416
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:25,760
garage. It's French with a single

2417
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:29,440
cylinder engine still runs. So yeah,

2418
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:32,679
these were some of the unique ones which

2419
01:54:32,679 --> 01:54:35,199
u were personal favorites. Let's put it

2420
01:54:35,199 --> 01:54:38,239
that way. What's the most ridiculously

2421
01:54:38,239 --> 01:54:39,679
expensive thing you have bought in your

2422
01:54:39,679 --> 01:54:43,400
life? It depends what I

2423
01:54:43,400 --> 01:54:46,239
mean. You're talking about a car, you're

2424
01:54:46,239 --> 01:54:50,119
talking about painting, you're talking

2425
01:54:50,119 --> 01:54:52,639
about property.

2426
01:54:52,639 --> 01:54:56,000
Give me example of one each.

2427
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,239
No, I mean

2428
01:54:58,239 --> 01:55:01,040
look uh I have a family trust set up by

2429
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:05,440
my father that you know uh has acquired

2430
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:07,520
various properties in different parts of

2431
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:08,360
the

2432
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:13,639
world. The media said I had over 20

2433
01:55:13,639 --> 01:55:15,760
properties probably one in each country

2434
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:19,639
I went to which is once again hugely

2435
01:55:19,639 --> 01:55:21,159
erroneous

2436
01:55:21,159 --> 01:55:23,520
exaggeration. Yeah, sure. I have

2437
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:26,239
properties in England, properties in

2438
01:55:26,239 --> 01:55:29,920
America where my kids live. I had a

2439
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:33,599
lovely property in France, which you

2440
01:55:33,599 --> 01:55:36,080
rightly pointed out

2441
01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:38,639
uh owned through Gizmo, which is a

2442
01:55:38,639 --> 01:55:40,119
holding

2443
01:55:40,119 --> 01:55:44,560
company. Uh yeah. And then when I had uh

2444
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:46,679
the big brewery business in South

2445
01:55:46,679 --> 01:55:51,119
Africa, we had a home in Cape Town which

2446
01:55:51,119 --> 01:55:52,880
was sold when the business was sold

2447
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:55,320
because I had no reason to keep going

2448
01:55:55,320 --> 01:55:59,280
there. That's about it. And you talk

2449
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:01,199
about one of your houses which was very

2450
01:56:01,199 --> 01:56:03,760
spoken about actually two of them. Yeah.

2451
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:08,239
One is that big bungalow which is above

2452
01:56:08,239 --> 01:56:09,840
which is in India at the King Fisher

2453
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:13,040
Tower. Bangalore Bangalore. started it

2454
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:16,159
started off as a joke. Okay. What story

2455
01:56:16,159 --> 01:56:17,639
behind it? The brewery

2456
01:56:17,639 --> 01:56:20,480
house which is the bungalow was on that

2457
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:22,840
piece of land for over 100

2458
01:56:22,840 --> 01:56:26,239
years. That's where I grew up in that

2459
01:56:26,239 --> 01:56:30,719
bungalow. That's where my father lived.

2460
01:56:30,719 --> 01:56:35,320
And so when these developers came

2461
01:56:35,320 --> 01:56:40,679
and asked me that that land should be

2462
01:56:40,679 --> 01:56:43,040
developed and that it would be very

2463
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:44,520
beneficial for the

2464
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:49,000
company and that there was a huge profit

2465
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,440
potential. I said, you know, I should

2466
01:56:51,440 --> 01:56:53,080
put the company

2467
01:56:53,080 --> 01:56:56,000
first and unlock the value and the

2468
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,800
potential rather than be

2469
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:01,480
uh selfish and say no, I'm not

2470
01:57:01,480 --> 01:57:05,760
moving. So in a joking way, I said to

2471
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:06,520
Van

2472
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:09,360
Razak of prestige, very dear friend of

2473
01:57:09,360 --> 01:57:13,639
mine, top man. I said

2474
01:57:13,639 --> 01:57:17,360
by if you lift this building and put it

2475
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:19,360
on top of the tower you want to build

2476
01:57:19,360 --> 01:57:21,360
I'll agree. He says okay that's what

2477
01:57:21,360 --> 01:57:26,599
we'll deliver that's what they did.

2478
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:28,880
Wow. What what is there in inside the

2479
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:30,320
house? I always wonder every time I go

2480
01:57:30,320 --> 01:57:32,480
to Bangalore. It's unfinished. It's

2481
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:34,400
unfinished because it's embroiled in

2482
01:57:34,400 --> 01:57:37,760
this UBL liquidation controversy right

2483
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:42,480
now. But you know given that the the

2484
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:46,560
banks are settled and I think UBHL

2485
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:49,199
should come out of liquidation and be

2486
01:57:49,199 --> 01:57:50,880
restored to its shareholders which is

2487
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:53,239
what I'm working on

2488
01:57:53,239 --> 01:57:57,840
now. Was this also a reason why because

2489
01:57:57,840 --> 01:58:01,280
you marketed so well and you marketed at

2490
01:58:01,280 --> 01:58:04,320
the place or with the tools which were

2491
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:06,840
very very public in nature very loud in

2492
01:58:06,840 --> 01:58:09,280
nature. There was a line which I read in

2493
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:12,719
a newspaper which said you were a show

2494
01:58:12,719 --> 01:58:15,400
you are a showman and your father was a

2495
01:58:15,400 --> 01:58:17,840
businessman. Is that is that why people

2496
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:20,000
misunderstand you because of the nature

2497
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,280
of your My father was a

2498
01:58:22,280 --> 01:58:24,840
businessman and I

2499
01:58:24,840 --> 01:58:27,520
really am not concerned about being

2500
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:29,639
referred to as a

2501
01:58:29,639 --> 01:58:32,960
showman because the showman created the

2502
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:36,040
world's largest alcoholic beverage

2503
01:58:36,040 --> 01:58:38,880
company which my father as a businessman

2504
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:41,520
would have loved to see.

2505
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:42,840
Do you think your

2506
01:58:42,840 --> 01:58:46,400
father if he was here with you things

2507
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:47,840
would have been different for you? You

2508
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:51,599
would not land in this? Absolutely not.

2509
01:58:51,599 --> 01:58:56,440
Absolutely not. I mean if you

2510
01:58:56,440 --> 01:58:59,000
see what I've been

2511
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,639
through, it's

2512
01:59:01,639 --> 01:59:04,320
illogical. It is a sustained campaign

2513
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:07,360
and a sustained attack on the

2514
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:11,280
government's favorite poster boy.

2515
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:13,400
Right now whether my dad was around or

2516
01:59:13,400 --> 01:59:16,639
not would not change anything what has

2517
01:59:16,639 --> 01:59:19,440
been attempted and what has been done

2518
01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:20,360
till

2519
01:59:20,360 --> 01:59:22,360
now the

2520
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:25,400
government officially recognizing and

2521
01:59:25,400 --> 01:59:28,560
admitting that 14,100 crores has been

2522
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:30,560
recovered. Okay. Let's go to a point

2523
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:33,520
where when we were talking about earlier

2524
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:36,560
about the kingfisher turmoil you said

2525
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:39,520
you went to the FM back then. Mhm. which

2526
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:42,679
was Pranav Mukharji

2527
01:59:42,679 --> 01:59:45,119
sir. What happened after that meeting?

2528
01:59:45,119 --> 01:59:47,360
He said that banks will support you. Is

2529
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:49,840
that the reason why a government bank

2530
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:51,440
supported you? It was not one government

2531
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:54,639
bank. It was a group of about 15 or 16

2532
01:59:54,639 --> 01:59:58,239
government banks. Kingfisher Airlines

2533
01:59:58,239 --> 02:00:01,119
never borrowed any money from State Bank

2534
02:00:01,119 --> 02:00:04,159
of India. Just to set the record

2535
02:00:04,159 --> 02:00:06,800
straight. Okay. State Bank of India was

2536
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:08,920
a lender to

2537
02:00:08,920 --> 02:00:12,280
Dean. When King Fisher and Dean

2538
02:00:12,280 --> 02:00:15,400
merged, State Bank of India became a

2539
02:00:15,400 --> 02:00:18,480
lender to King Fisher Alliance. But it

2540
02:00:18,480 --> 02:00:21,360
started with Dean. So like that there

2541
02:00:21,360 --> 02:00:22,880
were a group of banks from whom King

2542
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:25,679
Fisher had borrowed money. A group of

2543
02:00:25,679 --> 02:00:29,199
banks from whom Dean had borrowed money

2544
02:00:29,199 --> 02:00:31,520
and then they got combined into one

2545
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:35,400
entity when Dean and King Fisher merged.

2546
02:00:35,400 --> 02:00:39,440
Right. Yes. There were times when the

2547
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:42,719
the the sort of support from the finance

2548
02:00:42,719 --> 02:00:45,520
minister at that time meant that you

2549
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:48,239
know when I presented to various banks

2550
02:00:48,239 --> 02:00:50,000
including state bank that you know the

2551
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,639
airline needed money they would

2552
02:00:52,639 --> 02:00:54,320
recognize

2553
02:00:54,320 --> 02:00:57,679
um uh our financial needs appraise them

2554
02:00:57,679 --> 02:01:00,080
correctly through state bank of India

2555
02:01:00,080 --> 02:01:03,920
capital markets and then sanction loans

2556
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:05,400
even though the

2557
02:01:05,400 --> 02:01:07,920
creditworthiness uh of Kingpisher

2558
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:11,280
Airlines may have been short of norms.

2559
02:01:11,280 --> 02:01:14,400
To that extent, I'm grateful. Yes. But

2560
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:17,360
then, you know, I did my bit as well. I

2561
02:01:17,360 --> 02:01:21,520
put in 3,000 crores of UB group's money

2562
02:01:21,520 --> 02:01:24,400
into King Fisher Allies. You're talking

2563
02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:27,520
to me about allegations of siphoning.

2564
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:29,599
You're talking to me about allegations

2565
02:01:29,599 --> 02:01:32,560
of misusing Kingfisher Airlines funds

2566
02:01:32,560 --> 02:01:36,000
from my lifestyle for Formula 1. Nobody

2567
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,400
ever talks about that 3,000 crores I

2568
02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:41,280
infused in cash into King Fisher

2569
02:01:41,280 --> 02:01:43,599
Airlines to keep it afloat.

2570
02:01:43,599 --> 02:01:46,960
my good friend and uh you know probably

2571
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:49,599
the most successful lady entrepreneur

2572
02:01:49,599 --> 02:01:52,080
I've known she's like a sister to me

2573
02:01:52,080 --> 02:01:55,199
Kiran Mazumar has often said publicly

2574
02:01:55,199 --> 02:01:57,520
that Vijay put everything on the line

2575
02:01:57,520 --> 02:02:01,239
for king I did but that's not

2576
02:02:01,239 --> 02:02:03,880
appreciated that is not

2577
02:02:03,880 --> 02:02:06,880
appreciated that's sad but let the

2578
02:02:06,880 --> 02:02:09,920
narrative be what it is see you put

2579
02:02:09,920 --> 02:02:13,040
everything you had into reviving King

2580
02:02:13,040 --> 02:02:14,320
Fisher Airlines because you believed in

2581
02:02:14,320 --> 02:02:15,880
the vision. Mhm.

2582
02:02:15,880 --> 02:02:18,480
Right. But at the time when you asked

2583
02:02:18,480 --> 02:02:20,000
loans

2584
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,080
uh the company was not doing that great.

2585
02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:25,280
Correct. Right. So you but you still got

2586
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:28,400
loan from the consortium of 17 banks.

2587
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:30,239
Correct.

2588
02:02:30,239 --> 02:02:31,840
The reason was they believed in your

2589
02:02:31,840 --> 02:02:34,400
vision or the reason that they were

2590
02:02:34,400 --> 02:02:36,719
influenced by the by the government to

2591
02:02:36,719 --> 02:02:38,719
give you the loan. Yeah. They believed

2592
02:02:38,719 --> 02:02:41,360
in the vision. They did their own

2593
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:43,040
appraisals.

2594
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:45,840
Right. And please never forget I gave my

2595
02:02:45,840 --> 02:02:49,040
personal guarantee and United Breweries

2596
02:02:49,040 --> 02:02:52,599
Holdings Limited also gave its personal

2597
02:02:52,599 --> 02:02:55,480
guarantee. If anybody

2598
02:02:55,480 --> 02:03:00,960
had okay bad intentions, if anybody had

2599
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:04,080
intentions to divert money, siphon

2600
02:03:04,080 --> 02:03:06,440
money, steal money, could

2601
02:03:06,440 --> 02:03:09,920
anybody put themselves on a line with a

2602
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:13,599
personal guarantee? Think about it. So

2603
02:03:13,599 --> 02:03:17,360
all this narrative of

2604
02:03:20,520 --> 02:03:24,480
chore that is why I say in the last 9

2605
02:03:24,480 --> 02:03:27,440
years I haven't bothered about changing

2606
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:30,639
this narrative because it is what it is.

2607
02:03:30,639 --> 02:03:33,800
It's written by the Indian

2608
02:03:33,800 --> 02:03:36,599
media of course prompted by the

2609
02:03:36,599 --> 02:03:39,679
government who have had their own press

2610
02:03:39,679 --> 02:03:42,880
conferences etc. I mean Samit Patra, the

2611
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:46,080
BJP spokesman called a press conference

2612
02:03:46,080 --> 02:03:48,080
and bandied around in front of the

2613
02:03:48,080 --> 02:03:50,159
Indian media letters that I had written

2614
02:03:50,159 --> 02:03:53,520
to Prime Minister Manuan Singh trying to

2615
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:54,920
establish a

2616
02:03:54,920 --> 02:03:57,760
nexus right between me and the prime

2617
02:03:57,760 --> 02:04:00,080
minister and alleging some sort of

2618
02:04:00,080 --> 02:04:03,440
wrongdoing by the then Congress

2619
02:04:03,440 --> 02:04:06,800
um prime minister. I mean one could see

2620
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:08,360
through the political

2621
02:04:08,360 --> 02:04:12,400
rhetoric straight away. Why wouldn't any

2622
02:04:12,400 --> 02:04:14,000
Indian citizen write to the prime

2623
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:17,560
minister for help?

2624
02:04:17,599 --> 02:04:21,199
Fair because I never asked for money. I

2625
02:04:21,199 --> 02:04:24,639
asked only for policy changes. Let's go

2626
02:04:24,639 --> 02:04:27,119
to the series of events after this. What

2627
02:04:27,119 --> 02:04:31,719
happened? What happened? So I'm

2628
02:04:31,719 --> 02:04:34,960
quoting just pure research. Okay. Of

2629
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:37,199
quoting whom? quoting pure research of

2630
02:04:37,199 --> 02:04:40,960
what's out there on all the newspapers.

2631
02:04:40,960 --> 02:04:46,800
So you got a loan from banks and usually

2632
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:50,000
the normal nature of providing such big

2633
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:53,840
loans is people take people give you

2634
02:04:53,840 --> 02:04:55,400
this kind of loan against

2635
02:04:55,400 --> 02:04:58,560
collateral and in this case bank took

2636
02:04:58,560 --> 02:05:00,320
brand name of king fisher as collateral

2637
02:05:00,320 --> 02:05:01,760
and gave you the loan. One of the

2638
02:05:01,760 --> 02:05:03,520
collaterals. One of the collateral. What

2639
02:05:03,520 --> 02:05:05,199
were the other collaterals? Several

2640
02:05:05,199 --> 02:05:08,800
other stocks, shares, property. So

2641
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:11,840
stocks and shares, shares, property and

2642
02:05:11,840 --> 02:05:15,520
stock and shares which is again quoted

2643
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:17,719
at that time were at the price of

2644
02:05:17,719 --> 02:05:21,760
3839 but banks got it at 68.69. You talk

2645
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:23,840
about Kingfisher Alliance shares. Yeah.

2646
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:26,400
What about all the other shares of UBL

2647
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:28,159
and USL?

2648
02:05:28,159 --> 02:05:30,960
Nobody talks about that. But they where

2649
02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:33,040
do you think they got this 14,000 crores

2650
02:05:33,040 --> 02:05:35,599
from? I'm talking about back then like

2651
02:05:35,599 --> 02:05:38,719
one minute they have sold assets and

2652
02:05:38,719 --> 02:05:42,480
realized 14,100 crores. Yeah. Large part

2653
02:05:42,480 --> 02:05:45,760
of which were my shares.

2654
02:05:45,760 --> 02:05:48,560
So you have only focused on brand value.

2655
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:51,280
You've forgotten about the shares.

2656
02:05:51,280 --> 02:05:54,760
No, I'm suggested wait a minute. I never

2657
02:05:54,760 --> 02:05:57,280
suggested that the brand value would

2658
02:05:57,280 --> 02:06:00,000
generate 14,000 crores. my shares that

2659
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:01,400
were

2660
02:06:01,400 --> 02:06:04,719
pledged. So there's your answer to all

2661
02:06:04,719 --> 02:06:06,920
this

2662
02:06:06,920 --> 02:06:09,679
narrative. So you're saying that I'm not

2663
02:06:09,679 --> 02:06:11,679
saying it's fact. No. So the the facts

2664
02:06:11,679 --> 02:06:15,840
are what you are quoting is they took

2665
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:17,679
shares of King Visher Airlines at the

2666
02:06:17,679 --> 02:06:20,560
double price because they were also

2667
02:06:20,560 --> 02:06:23,440
getting shares of UB. Mhm. That's why

2668
02:06:23,440 --> 02:06:24,880
there was some kind of negotiation which

2669
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:27,360
was played on. No, no. It is a multiple

2670
02:06:27,360 --> 02:06:30,239
basket of securities.

2671
02:06:30,239 --> 02:06:33,360
But still, why would a bank twice the

2672
02:06:33,360 --> 02:06:37,119
share price? Look, nobody dreams up a

2673
02:06:37,119 --> 02:06:39,280
share value.

2674
02:06:39,280 --> 02:06:41,079
Okay, they were

2675
02:06:41,079 --> 02:06:43,599
professional merchant bankers including

2676
02:06:43,599 --> 02:06:45,719
State Bank of India, capital markets

2677
02:06:45,719 --> 02:06:50,400
involved. They arrived at a share value.

2678
02:06:50,400 --> 02:06:52,320
The part of the loan package was that

2679
02:06:52,320 --> 02:06:55,079
King Fisher's shares in the airline

2680
02:06:55,079 --> 02:06:58,239
itself needed to be pledged to the

2681
02:06:58,239 --> 02:07:00,880
banks. But that was all not the only

2682
02:07:00,880 --> 02:07:04,239
pledge. It was part of a basket. But

2683
02:07:04,239 --> 02:07:07,320
then the media chose to focus only on

2684
02:07:07,320 --> 02:07:10,239
that. So I would like to ask the legacy

2685
02:07:10,239 --> 02:07:12,920
media where did the 14,000 crores come

2686
02:07:12,920 --> 02:07:17,119
from? But you made such a halaboo about

2687
02:07:17,119 --> 02:07:19,840
share price of Kingfisher Airlines.

2688
02:07:19,840 --> 02:07:23,159
Now you see, now do you

2689
02:07:23,159 --> 02:07:26,639
see how people pick and choose to

2690
02:07:26,639 --> 02:07:29,119
discredit

2691
02:07:29,159 --> 02:07:33,360
you? Isn't it pretty evident? Okay. So

2692
02:07:33,360 --> 02:07:35,599
then this happened again. A business

2693
02:07:35,599 --> 02:07:37,840
decision by banks. They did everything.

2694
02:07:37,840 --> 02:07:39,480
There was no influence

2695
02:07:39,480 --> 02:07:41,760
involved. It was pure play business

2696
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:44,079
decision by a bank between you and the

2697
02:07:44,079 --> 02:07:46,760
banks. You should ask

2698
02:07:46,760 --> 02:07:49,599
them this question. You lent the money

2699
02:07:49,599 --> 02:07:52,000
on what basis you lend the money they

2700
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:55,639
should answer the question I'm the

2701
02:07:55,639 --> 02:07:58,320
receiver first of all and let me clarify

2702
02:07:58,320 --> 02:08:01,520
here when you keep saying you borrowed I

2703
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:05,440
never borrowed one na pisa vijay mallaya

2704
02:08:05,440 --> 02:08:08,800
has never borrowed a single rupee from

2705
02:08:08,800 --> 02:08:09,960
anybody

2706
02:08:09,960 --> 02:08:12,880
ever it was king fisher airlines the

2707
02:08:12,880 --> 02:08:16,520
running company that borrowed I was a

2708
02:08:16,520 --> 02:08:19,679
guarantor there's a big difference and

2709
02:08:19,679 --> 02:08:22,239
then the money came in but you still

2710
02:08:22,239 --> 02:08:24,880
Kingfish Airlines was still bleeding

2711
02:08:24,880 --> 02:08:26,800
whatever the case may be I also put

2712
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:28,960
3,000 crores you put in 3,000 crores you

2713
02:08:28,960 --> 02:08:31,280
put in everything and you tried to

2714
02:08:31,280 --> 02:08:34,320
revive it and then one series of event

2715
02:08:34,320 --> 02:08:35,079
happened

2716
02:08:35,079 --> 02:08:39,280
where there was a non-payment of the oil

2717
02:08:39,280 --> 02:08:41,040
bills and that's why the oil companies

2718
02:08:41,040 --> 02:08:43,599
as started asking you for advanced money

2719
02:08:43,599 --> 02:08:46,079
and that shaked you a little bit more

2720
02:08:46,079 --> 02:08:48,079
yeah the working capital cycle got

2721
02:08:48,079 --> 02:08:52,480
disrupted. M natural. Then there was

2722
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:56,400
another series of event that Kingfisher

2723
02:08:56,400 --> 02:08:58,159
Airlines was not able to pay the airport

2724
02:08:58,159 --> 02:09:00,639
fees, the landing charges. Listen, when

2725
02:09:00,639 --> 02:09:02,800
a company goes through a cash flow

2726
02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:06,079
issue, it affects everybody. Yeah. You

2727
02:09:06,079 --> 02:09:08,639
cannot isolate one particular creditor

2728
02:09:08,639 --> 02:09:11,040
or vendor.

2729
02:09:11,040 --> 02:09:13,560
No. So I'm coming if there's a cash

2730
02:09:13,560 --> 02:09:16,960
shortage. Okay. It's across the board. H

2731
02:09:16,960 --> 02:09:18,480
so across the board then there were

2732
02:09:18,480 --> 02:09:20,000
catering companies which were affected

2733
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,639
there was no food everybody after one by

2734
02:09:22,639 --> 02:09:24,800
one one by one there was non-payment of

2735
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:28,000
certain things cash flow issue did you

2736
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,800
at any point did you think that this not

2737
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:32,880
going to work you were still pushing you

2738
02:09:32,880 --> 02:09:34,679
still push I was pushing I was

2739
02:09:34,679 --> 02:09:38,239
pushing in the hope that the foreign

2740
02:09:38,239 --> 02:09:40,360
investment that I had already

2741
02:09:40,360 --> 02:09:42,920
negotiated was going to

2742
02:09:42,920 --> 02:09:46,880
fractify which I had already agreed

2743
02:09:46,880 --> 02:09:49,400
right with James

2744
02:09:49,400 --> 02:09:53,520
Hogan. But the permission never came. It

2745
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:54,679
was

2746
02:09:54,679 --> 02:09:59,199
sad and I guess my misfortune that 6

2747
02:09:59,199 --> 02:10:01,040
months after King Fisher collapsed in

2748
02:10:01,040 --> 02:10:04,560
October 2012 that the same Ethi was

2749
02:10:04,560 --> 02:10:07,280
granted permission to invest in Jedways.

2750
02:10:07,280 --> 02:10:10,000
Okay. Then another thing happened. Okay.

2751
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,159
So you were expecting all of this would

2752
02:10:12,159 --> 02:10:13,679
happen.

2753
02:10:13,679 --> 02:10:17,199
You asked your people, your staff, your

2754
02:10:17,199 --> 02:10:20,719
employees to wait. Mhm. That the money

2755
02:10:20,719 --> 02:10:22,639
will come in.

2756
02:10:22,639 --> 02:10:24,960
Yeah. But they were not paid. The staff

2757
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:29,119
was not paid. Sadly, no. Right. Mhm. But

2758
02:10:29,119 --> 02:10:31,040
there's again a statement that your

2759
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:32,400
international employees were getting

2760
02:10:32,400 --> 02:10:35,520
paid. Indian employees were not. Mhm.

2761
02:10:35,520 --> 02:10:37,119
And the reason is that because

2762
02:10:37,119 --> 02:10:38,480
internationally you would have held

2763
02:10:38,480 --> 02:10:40,000
accountable in India, you could get away

2764
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,960
with anything. Was that the reason? I

2765
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:44,719
didn't know that. But why were you

2766
02:10:44,719 --> 02:10:46,000
paying international employees and not

2767
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,800
yours? It's very simple. The money was

2768
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:51,880
available through ticket collections in

2769
02:10:51,880 --> 02:10:54,159
England. Because money was available,

2770
02:10:54,159 --> 02:10:58,079
staff salaries were paid. In India, the

2771
02:10:58,079 --> 02:11:00,719
High Court of Karnataka had frozen over

2772
02:11:00,719 --> 02:11:03,719
260 crores worth of

2773
02:11:03,719 --> 02:11:06,560
cash. Okay. Now, I'd like to focus on

2774
02:11:06,560 --> 02:11:09,440
this non-payment of salaries. There has

2775
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:14,159
been a hell of a lot spoken about it.

2776
02:11:14,159 --> 02:11:16,119
All

2777
02:11:16,119 --> 02:11:20,400
right. Which has pained me no end. It

2778
02:11:20,400 --> 02:11:22,840
has seriously pained

2779
02:11:22,840 --> 02:11:27,960
me in my track record as chairman of UB

2780
02:11:27,960 --> 02:11:32,239
group. I would ask anyone to check on

2781
02:11:32,239 --> 02:11:35,520
how I cared for my

2782
02:11:36,119 --> 02:11:39,679
employees. I was proud of the care that

2783
02:11:39,679 --> 02:11:42,239
I gave to my employees.

2784
02:11:42,239 --> 02:11:43,920
Why would it be different for King

2785
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:46,320
Fisher

2786
02:11:47,159 --> 02:11:50,760
employees? The company in India had no

2787
02:11:50,760 --> 02:11:54,239
money. There was UB's money of 260

2788
02:11:54,239 --> 02:11:57,440
crores in the bank with the sorry with

2789
02:11:57,440 --> 02:11:59,119
the bank under the control of the

2790
02:11:59,119 --> 02:12:01,440
government of Karnataka.

2791
02:12:01,440 --> 02:12:05,840
We applied officially and formally to

2792
02:12:05,840 --> 02:12:09,840
the IC court please release the sal

2793
02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:12,840
money to pay the

2794
02:12:12,840 --> 02:12:17,599
salaries. Court said no. Why? The same

2795
02:12:17,599 --> 02:12:19,320
banks

2796
02:12:19,320 --> 02:12:22,239
objected. The same public sector banks

2797
02:12:22,239 --> 02:12:25,239
objected.

2798
02:12:25,679 --> 02:12:29,040
Why? Why? Because they said that money

2799
02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:31,760
belongs to them. because the company had

2800
02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:35,280
defaulted in payments. But as far as I

2801
02:12:35,280 --> 02:12:36,679
was

2802
02:12:36,679 --> 02:12:40,000
concerned, I asked the court, please

2803
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,239
release those monies to pay the employee

2804
02:12:42,239 --> 02:12:45,119
salaries. The banks objected, the courts

2805
02:12:45,119 --> 02:12:47,280
refused.

2806
02:12:47,280 --> 02:12:49,440
But you personally took salary from

2807
02:12:49,440 --> 02:12:52,400
Kingfish Airlines 33 crores a year. No,

2808
02:12:52,400 --> 02:12:56,239
no, no. I took salary of 33 crores a

2809
02:12:56,239 --> 02:12:59,199
year. I wish. Why do they talk about it?

2810
02:12:59,199 --> 02:13:00,880
Who talks? Show me the balance sheet

2811
02:13:00,880 --> 02:13:03,119
where it's written.

2812
02:13:03,119 --> 02:13:05,199
Can you show me? Not the balance sheet,

2813
02:13:05,199 --> 02:13:06,719
but the media talks about it. I can show

2814
02:13:06,719 --> 02:13:08,320
you an article. Ask the media where's

2815
02:13:08,320 --> 02:13:09,840
the balance sheet. So, you never took

2816
02:13:09,840 --> 02:13:12,079
salary? I never took 33 crores of

2817
02:13:12,079 --> 02:13:14,320
salary. Or did you take any salary when

2818
02:13:14,320 --> 02:13:15,520
other people were not getting paid?

2819
02:13:15,520 --> 02:13:18,000
Obviously

2820
02:13:18,520 --> 02:13:21,960
not. I mean, you really think I'd pay

2821
02:13:21,960 --> 02:13:26,079
myself to the exclusion of other less

2822
02:13:26,079 --> 02:13:28,719
wellto-do employees? That's what the

2823
02:13:28,719 --> 02:13:31,159
world thinks. That's

2824
02:13:31,159 --> 02:13:33,960
unfortunate view of the world about

2825
02:13:33,960 --> 02:13:38,239
me which is sadly completely false. But

2826
02:13:38,239 --> 02:13:39,920
then they all were on the road striking

2827
02:13:39,920 --> 02:13:42,560
against you if you would have spoken to

2828
02:13:42,560 --> 02:13:44,639
them in a nicer way probably. I don't

2829
02:13:44,639 --> 02:13:47,920
know spoken to them try to explain to

2830
02:13:47,920 --> 02:13:51,920
them but at the end of the day they did

2831
02:13:51,920 --> 02:13:54,000
what they thought was best. They were

2832
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,960
under stress. I respect that. I'm not

2833
02:13:56,960 --> 02:13:57,880
blaming

2834
02:13:57,880 --> 02:14:00,560
anybody. Okay. A couple of people have

2835
02:14:00,560 --> 02:14:04,320
said some nasty things which is fine if

2836
02:14:04,320 --> 02:14:05,560
they are under

2837
02:14:05,560 --> 02:14:08,159
pressure and their livelihood was under

2838
02:14:08,159 --> 02:14:11,360
pressure. I fully understand that and I

2839
02:14:11,360 --> 02:14:14,920
take it in my stride. But the fact any

2840
02:14:14,920 --> 02:14:18,400
suggestion that I willfully did not pay

2841
02:14:18,400 --> 02:14:21,679
or that I ignored them and enriched

2842
02:14:21,679 --> 02:14:24,159
myself in the process is completely

2843
02:14:24,159 --> 02:14:25,599
false.

2844
02:14:25,599 --> 02:14:27,920
While all of this was happening,

2845
02:14:27,920 --> 02:14:29,560
something really tragic

2846
02:14:29,560 --> 02:14:33,360
happened. One of your employees wife

2847
02:14:33,360 --> 02:14:35,760
committed a suicide because they were

2848
02:14:35,760 --> 02:14:37,280
not able to pay themselves. Were you

2849
02:14:37,280 --> 02:14:39,840
aware of that? I became aware of that

2850
02:14:39,840 --> 02:14:43,639
and upon investigation

2851
02:14:43,639 --> 02:14:46,719
um that was the culmination of a

2852
02:14:46,719 --> 02:14:48,920
longstanding

2853
02:14:48,920 --> 02:14:52,000
dispute, marital dispute.

2854
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:53,920
It was convenient to blame it on King

2855
02:14:53,920 --> 02:14:55,599
Fisher Airlines and non-payment of

2856
02:14:55,599 --> 02:14:58,960
salaries. Once again, when people are

2857
02:14:58,960 --> 02:15:00,639
under stress and under unpleasant

2858
02:15:00,639 --> 02:15:03,800
circumstances, I don't want to um

2859
02:15:03,800 --> 02:15:07,840
comment on it uh in an unsavory way. It

2860
02:15:07,840 --> 02:15:10,480
would not be right on my part. I mean,

2861
02:15:10,480 --> 02:15:13,840
my sympathies are with the family that

2862
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:15,800
um, you know,

2863
02:15:15,800 --> 02:15:19,960
lost one of their kin, but I can tell

2864
02:15:19,960 --> 02:15:25,560
you that we investigated the matter and

2865
02:15:25,560 --> 02:15:29,599
okay, sadly, the tragedy did happen. Uh,

2866
02:15:29,599 --> 02:15:32,520
and yes, sadly, equally sadly, that

2867
02:15:32,520 --> 02:15:37,520
family had not been paid their salary.

2868
02:15:37,520 --> 02:15:39,520
If you'd like to blame it on on me,

2869
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:41,920
fine. I'll take the blame. As I said,

2870
02:15:41,920 --> 02:15:45,199
I'm not afraid of taking blame where

2871
02:15:45,199 --> 02:15:48,960
blame is due. Now, I can face up to

2872
02:15:48,960 --> 02:15:52,239
reality and truth.

2873
02:15:52,239 --> 02:15:53,760
Did you feel like you should have said

2874
02:15:53,760 --> 02:15:56,400
sorry to employees?

2875
02:15:56,400 --> 02:15:59,880
Because you were not condolence letters

2876
02:15:59,880 --> 02:16:04,320
for Yeah, but I didn't copy the media.

2877
02:16:04,320 --> 02:16:06,159
I wrote a letter of condolence, but I

2878
02:16:06,159 --> 02:16:09,880
didn't copy the media.

2879
02:16:11,119 --> 02:16:12,960
You know, here was here was what pissed

2880
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:16,079
people off that in your private life,

2881
02:16:16,079 --> 02:16:18,079
you were enjoying.

2882
02:16:18,079 --> 02:16:21,679
You were buying the Tu Sultan swad. You

2883
02:16:21,679 --> 02:16:25,360
were buying cars in the UK. The value of

2884
02:16:25,360 --> 02:16:27,679
a Tipu Sultan sword would not have paid

2885
02:16:27,679 --> 02:16:29,520
salaries.

2886
02:16:29,520 --> 02:16:32,559
The two MercedesBenz cars, the figment

2887
02:16:32,559 --> 02:16:34,559
of people's imagination, would not have

2888
02:16:34,559 --> 02:16:37,200
paid the salaries.

2889
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:39,439
And if your suggestion is that I should

2890
02:16:39,439 --> 02:16:43,719
have laid low in some artificial

2891
02:16:43,719 --> 02:16:47,080
way, forget the

2892
02:16:47,080 --> 02:16:49,319
employees, forget the

2893
02:16:49,319 --> 02:16:51,599
shareholders of all the other

2894
02:16:51,599 --> 02:16:54,120
businesses, United Spirits, United

2895
02:16:54,120 --> 02:16:57,080
Breweries, MCF,

2896
02:16:57,080 --> 02:17:00,080
everybody really. That would have been

2897
02:17:00,080 --> 02:17:03,960
very fair, isn't it?

2898
02:17:06,080 --> 02:17:07,559
and

2899
02:17:07,559 --> 02:17:12,719
behave behave in a manner where my only

2900
02:17:12,719 --> 02:17:14,800
asset and liability in life was

2901
02:17:14,800 --> 02:17:18,920
kingfisher airlines I had nothing

2902
02:17:18,920 --> 02:17:21,120
else that's the way I should have

2903
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:22,120
behaved

2904
02:17:22,120 --> 02:17:25,000
right what about the salaries of the

2905
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,280
other employees of the other group

2906
02:17:27,280 --> 02:17:29,519
companies what about the shareholders of

2907
02:17:29,519 --> 02:17:31,240
those

2908
02:17:31,240 --> 02:17:33,920
companies what about the future of those

2909
02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:35,800
companies and the management of those

2910
02:17:35,800 --> 02:17:38,599
companies. So sadly if one company

2911
02:17:38,599 --> 02:17:41,120
fails, is it your suggestion that the

2912
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:44,840
whole group must fail?

2913
02:17:44,880 --> 02:17:46,920
No, definitely not.

2914
02:17:46,920 --> 02:17:50,559
Okay. Everybody loves to talk about the

2915
02:17:50,559 --> 02:17:52,920
failure of King Airlines and of

2916
02:17:52,920 --> 02:17:56,840
course pin me the blame on me

2917
02:17:56,840 --> 02:17:58,719
personally. Forget about everything

2918
02:17:58,719 --> 02:18:00,719
else. It is Vijay Malia's failure. Vijay

2919
02:18:00,719 --> 02:18:03,679
Malia's failure. Vijay Malaka Chi, Vijay

2920
02:18:03,679 --> 02:18:05,200
Malaka Fraud, everything is Vijay

2921
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:09,200
Mallaya. Fine. What

2922
02:18:09,800 --> 02:18:12,479
about United Spirits Limited, United

2923
02:18:12,479 --> 02:18:16,639
Breweries Limited from where it started

2924
02:18:16,639 --> 02:18:18,519
to where I left

2925
02:18:18,519 --> 02:18:22,000
off and the wealth creation in the hands

2926
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:23,399
of

2927
02:18:23,399 --> 02:18:25,920
shareholders and the wealth creation in

2928
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:27,160
the hands of

2929
02:18:27,160 --> 02:18:29,840
employees probably amongst the highest

2930
02:18:29,840 --> 02:18:32,359
in India in the corporate sector

2931
02:18:32,359 --> 02:18:34,519
highest all

2932
02:18:34,519 --> 02:18:38,639
forgotten nobody even refers to it. King

2933
02:18:38,639 --> 02:18:41,519
Fisher Island

2934
02:18:42,679 --> 02:18:46,319
Malaya that's it the narrative begins

2935
02:18:46,319 --> 02:18:49,359
there ends

2936
02:18:49,800 --> 02:18:53,280
there. Do you think if you would have

2937
02:18:53,280 --> 02:18:55,200
done things differently probably this

2938
02:18:55,200 --> 02:18:56,719
side of you would have been more

2939
02:18:56,719 --> 02:18:59,080
celebrated than the side which has

2940
02:18:59,080 --> 02:19:02,599
gotten once the media

2941
02:19:02,599 --> 02:19:05,200
started beginning with one particular

2942
02:19:05,200 --> 02:19:07,960
channel whose anchor is

2943
02:19:07,960 --> 02:19:09,960
known

2944
02:19:09,960 --> 02:19:13,000
right to shout the house

2945
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:14,599
down

2946
02:19:14,599 --> 02:19:17,840
right what did I start by saying vija I

2947
02:19:17,840 --> 02:19:20,200
want to see you eating jail

2948
02:19:20,200 --> 02:19:23,840
food. I want to see you in jail clothes,

2949
02:19:23,840 --> 02:19:24,760
etc.,

2950
02:19:24,760 --> 02:19:27,280
etc. Started from there. Everybody had

2951
02:19:27,280 --> 02:19:30,000
to jump on the

2952
02:19:31,960 --> 02:19:34,479
bandwagon. I think in the same time,

2953
02:19:34,479 --> 02:19:36,719
because we're talking about events,

2954
02:19:36,719 --> 02:19:37,880
somebody

2955
02:19:37,880 --> 02:19:42,519
mentioned that you took out 35

2956
02:19:42,519 --> 02:19:45,439
million and invested in buying

2957
02:19:45,439 --> 02:19:49,200
properties in France. Rubbish. some with

2958
02:19:49,200 --> 02:19:52,560
some uh dummy company called I think

2959
02:19:52,560 --> 02:19:54,720
Gizmo holding or something like that.

2960
02:19:54,720 --> 02:19:59,840
Tell me if I had siphoned King Fer money

2961
02:19:59,840 --> 02:20:04,080
to such an extent as people suggest

2962
02:20:04,080 --> 02:20:06,960
how would the LN

2963
02:20:08,040 --> 02:20:11,280
run on the bank's own admission on the

2964
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:15,160
debt recovery tribunal's own admission

2965
02:20:15,160 --> 02:20:18,399
4,999 crores was a debt

2966
02:20:18,399 --> 02:20:21,920
right rest is all

2967
02:20:22,280 --> 02:20:24,800
interest. His suggestions are that I

2968
02:20:24,800 --> 02:20:28,160
have stolen or misused most of that or

2969
02:20:28,160 --> 02:20:32,080
all of it. How would the aine

2970
02:20:34,359 --> 02:20:37,040
fly if all the money borrowed from the

2971
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:38,880
banks Vijay Malia pocketed? How would

2972
02:20:38,880 --> 02:20:42,520
the aine fly?

2973
02:20:45,920 --> 02:20:47,800
So all these

2974
02:20:47,800 --> 02:20:50,720
allegations and false narratives being

2975
02:20:50,720 --> 02:20:53,600
painted by people, if you analyze them,

2976
02:20:53,600 --> 02:20:56,200
they make no

2977
02:20:56,200 --> 02:20:58,960
sense. What also is not making sense to

2978
02:20:58,960 --> 02:21:02,240
me is when the government said that

2979
02:21:02,240 --> 02:21:05,680
they're going to support you in 2008,

2980
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:07,640
the FM said that they'll provide the

2981
02:21:07,640 --> 02:21:11,359
loan, which they probably did with the

2982
02:21:11,359 --> 02:21:14,000
banks. Mhm.

2983
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,040
Later in

2984
02:21:16,040 --> 02:21:18,920
2011, the union minister of the same

2985
02:21:18,920 --> 02:21:22,399
government objection like he started or

2986
02:21:22,399 --> 02:21:24,640
they started objecting that you were not

2987
02:21:24,640 --> 02:21:27,280
paying even taxes 150 cr was spending

2988
02:21:27,280 --> 02:21:29,439
and they started putting you in the

2989
02:21:29,439 --> 02:21:32,520
public eye. They were

2990
02:21:32,520 --> 02:21:35,760
aras areas.

2991
02:21:35,760 --> 02:21:39,680
Nobody is disputing that. But compare my

2992
02:21:39,680 --> 02:21:44,000
areas with their India's areas.

2993
02:21:45,520 --> 02:21:47,920
Air India's areas were probably 10 times

2994
02:21:47,920 --> 02:21:50,960
that of Kingfisher Airlines. That was

2995
02:21:50,960 --> 02:21:54,760
because of the stress of the aviation

2996
02:21:54,760 --> 02:21:58,479
sector. And why did Air India didn't get

2997
02:21:58,479 --> 02:22:02,120
anything and you got everything every

2998
02:22:02,120 --> 02:22:04,479
little every little scrutiny happened

2999
02:22:04,479 --> 02:22:06,880
with you if Air India was in trouble

3000
02:22:06,880 --> 02:22:08,560
more than you which actually was the

3001
02:22:08,560 --> 02:22:10,880
case. It's a fact. Yeah, it's a fact.

3002
02:22:10,880 --> 02:22:13,840
They were in more they were in a more

3003
02:22:13,840 --> 02:22:15,680
daunting situation than yours like the

3004
02:22:15,680 --> 02:22:17,920
airline. Yeah, but all the focus was

3005
02:22:17,920 --> 02:22:21,120
only King for sure. Why? You should ask

3006
02:22:21,120 --> 02:22:23,840
those that why do you think turned on

3007
02:22:23,840 --> 02:22:26,319
the spotlights? Why do you think it

3008
02:22:26,319 --> 02:22:27,680
happened?

3009
02:22:27,680 --> 02:22:32,439
Clearly combination of animosity,

3010
02:22:32,439 --> 02:22:35,120
jealousy, whole bunch of factors and you

3011
02:22:35,120 --> 02:22:37,600
know once again unproductive things to

3012
02:22:37,600 --> 02:22:40,479
to think about you know in life think

3013
02:22:40,479 --> 02:22:42,560
positive.

3014
02:22:42,560 --> 02:22:45,120
Come on it costed you a whole life in

3015
02:22:45,120 --> 02:22:47,840
India. You must have thought about it

3016
02:22:47,840 --> 02:22:51,359
hundreds of times. No I'm not. In any

3017
02:22:51,359 --> 02:22:52,760
case, since

3018
02:22:52,760 --> 02:22:55,439
1988, I've been going to India for less

3019
02:22:55,439 --> 02:22:57,479
than 180 days in a

3020
02:22:57,479 --> 02:23:00,359
year. All my three children are American

3021
02:23:00,359 --> 02:23:02,880
citizens. All have lived outside India,

3022
02:23:02,880 --> 02:23:05,680
never in India. My mother has been in

3023
02:23:05,680 --> 02:23:08,720
this country for over 30 years. What do

3024
02:23:08,720 --> 02:23:09,800
I go back

3025
02:23:09,800 --> 02:23:12,720
to? Of course, I will get the most

3026
02:23:12,720 --> 02:23:15,359
ceremonial welcome by the Indian media.

3027
02:23:15,359 --> 02:23:16,880
Of course, sure I will. My goodness,

3028
02:23:16,880 --> 02:23:18,399
it'll be headlines of every single

3029
02:23:18,399 --> 02:23:20,880
newspaper. Okay. Okay. So 2012 the

3030
02:23:20,880 --> 02:23:23,680
airline got suspended. Non-payment of

3031
02:23:23,680 --> 02:23:25,280
multiple things, working capital, cash

3032
02:23:25,280 --> 02:23:28,240
flow, everything got really really bad

3033
02:23:28,240 --> 02:23:32,120
for you, right? And

3034
02:23:32,120 --> 02:23:34,960
then the big bash happened, the birthday

3035
02:23:34,960 --> 02:23:37,040
party which is often talked about in

3036
02:23:37,040 --> 02:23:39,040
2015.

3037
02:23:39,040 --> 02:23:41,240
Go ahead. What happened between 2012 and

3038
02:23:41,240 --> 02:23:44,720
2015 with this case? What happened? I'm

3039
02:23:44,720 --> 02:23:46,640
asking you what happened during like did

3040
02:23:46,640 --> 02:23:49,399
everybody forgot? What did

3041
02:23:49,399 --> 02:23:51,520
everybody like they were not bothered

3042
02:23:51,520 --> 02:23:52,720
about Kingfisher Airlines or what were

3043
02:23:52,720 --> 02:23:54,240
the cases were going on? Of course

3044
02:23:54,240 --> 02:23:55,520
everything was going on. Nothing

3045
02:23:55,520 --> 02:23:58,399
stopped. M Nothing stopped because

3046
02:23:58,399 --> 02:24:00,319
people don't talk about that often. What

3047
02:24:00,319 --> 02:24:01,920
happened? Like what was going on?

3048
02:24:01,920 --> 02:24:03,280
Nothing was going on. That's when the

3049
02:24:03,280 --> 02:24:05,920
willful defaulter and all that. You know

3050
02:24:05,920 --> 02:24:07,600
what the willful defaulter is all about,

3051
02:24:07,600 --> 02:24:09,680
right? Tell me what is about what banks

3052
02:24:09,680 --> 02:24:12,240
call a willful defaulter

3053
02:24:12,240 --> 02:24:14,399
of somebody who has the money but won't

3054
02:24:14,399 --> 02:24:16,399
pay. Yeah. That's called a willful

3055
02:24:16,399 --> 02:24:18,439
deferral. Yeah.

3056
02:24:18,439 --> 02:24:21,280
Right. I made four settlement offers to

3057
02:24:21,280 --> 02:24:24,560
the banks between 2012 to 2015. Yes.

3058
02:24:24,560 --> 02:24:27,399
Which they refused to

3059
02:24:27,399 --> 02:24:30,960
accept that nobody knows. What was the

3060
02:24:30,960 --> 02:24:32,399
settlement that you were offering? So

3061
02:24:32,399 --> 02:24:34,160
many settlement offers including before

3062
02:24:34,160 --> 02:24:35,000
the

3063
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,439
court. Right. So it was always the

3064
02:24:37,439 --> 02:24:39,760
intention to settle. I flew through

3065
02:24:39,760 --> 02:24:42,479
Hyderabad and met the chairperson of the

3066
02:24:42,479 --> 02:24:44,240
State Bank of India at their training

3067
02:24:44,240 --> 02:24:46,439
academy in Hyderabad and offered a

3068
02:24:46,439 --> 02:24:48,880
settlement. It was always my intention

3069
02:24:48,880 --> 02:24:50,880
to settle. Never did I say I'm not going

3070
02:24:50,880 --> 02:24:54,040
to pay.

3071
02:24:54,080 --> 02:24:55,600
And why do you think they didn't accept

3072
02:24:55,600 --> 02:24:59,520
it? They wanted 14,100 crores. That's

3073
02:24:59,520 --> 02:25:03,720
why they didn't accept it then.

3074
02:25:05,520 --> 02:25:07,200
They didn't want your 5,000 cr because

3075
02:25:07,200 --> 02:25:09,200
they were expecting it to go up. Like

3076
02:25:09,200 --> 02:25:10,640
the sale of your assets will be much

3077
02:25:10,640 --> 02:25:14,359
higher than whatever. Is that

3078
02:25:14,359 --> 02:25:17,040
Yeah. Had they accepted my offer, they

3079
02:25:17,040 --> 02:25:19,359
would have got 5,000 crores. Today

3080
02:25:19,359 --> 02:25:22,399
they've got 14,100 crores. But is there

3081
02:25:22,399 --> 02:25:25,439
any proof do you have where you offered

3082
02:25:25,439 --> 02:25:27,120
them settlement and they didn't accept

3083
02:25:27,120 --> 02:25:28,880
from 2015? The records of the Supreme

3084
02:25:28,880 --> 02:25:30,359
Court of

3085
02:25:30,359 --> 02:25:33,680
India. Proof. What better proof than the

3086
02:25:33,680 --> 02:25:37,600
records of the Supreme Court of India,

3087
02:25:37,600 --> 02:25:40,920
public documents,

3088
02:25:43,920 --> 02:25:46,840
so let's say you offered Yeah. nothing

3089
02:25:46,840 --> 02:25:50,280
happened. Nobody, not even a needle

3090
02:25:50,280 --> 02:25:53,680
moved. It just kept going on. It kept

3091
02:25:53,680 --> 02:25:54,680
getting

3092
02:25:54,680 --> 02:25:57,040
worse. And you knew this trouble was

3093
02:25:57,040 --> 02:26:00,160
going on.

3094
02:26:00,160 --> 02:26:01,720
And in

3095
02:26:01,720 --> 02:26:04,800
2015, apparently according to the media,

3096
02:26:04,800 --> 02:26:07,600
this is where things went down where you

3097
02:26:07,600 --> 02:26:10,399
had a grand birthday party. Your 60th

3098
02:26:10,399 --> 02:26:14,560
birthday party 18th December. Mhm. 2015,

3099
02:26:14,560 --> 02:26:17,359
right? Correct. What happened in that

3100
02:26:17,359 --> 02:26:20,680
party? Nothing. It was party

3101
02:26:20,680 --> 02:26:23,520
that normal party that I had and I've

3102
02:26:23,520 --> 02:26:27,520
had so many of them over the years.

3103
02:26:27,520 --> 02:26:28,800
Do you think you wouldn't you shouldn't

3104
02:26:28,800 --> 02:26:30,399
have done that party or made it so

3105
02:26:30,399 --> 02:26:32,040
public? But

3106
02:26:32,040 --> 02:26:34,960
why? Why? Because the whole narrative is

3107
02:26:34,960 --> 02:26:37,040
against you. You spending see this is

3108
02:26:37,040 --> 02:26:39,120
what a common person would think. If I

3109
02:26:39,120 --> 02:26:41,120
was a kingisher employee and I've not

3110
02:26:41,120 --> 02:26:44,240
gotten paid for XYZ reason, for let's

3111
02:26:44,240 --> 02:26:47,040
say economic factors, business model,

3112
02:26:47,040 --> 02:26:48,760
whatever XYZ reason, I'm not getting

3113
02:26:48,760 --> 02:26:51,120
paid. My livelihood is dependent on

3114
02:26:51,120 --> 02:26:53,439
this. And then I see the promoter of my

3115
02:26:53,439 --> 02:26:55,760
company spending millions of dollars or

3116
02:26:55,760 --> 02:26:57,680
Enrique Glacias to perform for his

3117
02:26:57,680 --> 02:27:01,160
birthday party. I would get

3118
02:27:01,160 --> 02:27:04,960
enraged. I want to as an employee at

3119
02:27:04,960 --> 02:27:07,120
that point if I'm not gotten if I've not

3120
02:27:07,120 --> 02:27:09,040
gotten paid. I don't understand that

3121
02:27:09,040 --> 02:27:10,479
there are 50 businesses that you have

3122
02:27:10,479 --> 02:27:12,560
built. I understand only one thing that

3123
02:27:12,560 --> 02:27:14,439
the promoter of my company is

3124
02:27:14,439 --> 02:27:17,840
enjoying on my expense.

3125
02:27:17,840 --> 02:27:19,600
the I would agree with everything that

3126
02:27:19,600 --> 02:27:21,479
you said except your

3127
02:27:21,479 --> 02:27:24,200
last at my

3128
02:27:24,200 --> 02:27:26,560
expense. The promoter of the I'm talking

3129
02:27:26,560 --> 02:27:28,080
a common person that's asking fair

3130
02:27:28,080 --> 02:27:30,520
enough that common person didn't

3131
02:27:30,520 --> 02:27:33,600
know that upon objection by the same

3132
02:27:33,600 --> 02:27:37,359
banks a Karnataka high court declined to

3133
02:27:37,359 --> 02:27:41,040
to agree to drawing readily available

3134
02:27:41,040 --> 02:27:42,520
cash to pay the

3135
02:27:42,520 --> 02:27:44,040
salaries.

3136
02:27:44,040 --> 02:27:47,120
Right. Okay. I agree with you. The

3137
02:27:47,120 --> 02:27:50,640
suffering employee would have also said

3138
02:27:50,640 --> 02:27:52,560
the man has United Breweries, United

3139
02:27:52,560 --> 02:27:54,040
Spirits is none of my

3140
02:27:54,040 --> 02:27:57,160
business. Right.

3141
02:27:57,160 --> 02:27:59,600
Right. So I could have been a thorough

3142
02:27:59,600 --> 02:28:01,280
hypocrite.

3143
02:28:01,280 --> 02:28:03,439
I could have come here to London and had

3144
02:28:03,439 --> 02:28:04,960
my party and nobody would have even

3145
02:28:04,960 --> 02:28:07,960
known,

3146
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,960
right?

3147
02:28:10,960 --> 02:28:12,240
Yeah. Would that have solved the

3148
02:28:12,240 --> 02:28:15,280
problem? No. Okay. But you didn't do

3149
02:28:15,280 --> 02:28:17,840
that. You did the public party in India.

3150
02:28:17,840 --> 02:28:20,080
It's not public. Sorry. It was by

3151
02:28:20,080 --> 02:28:22,240
invitation. But of course, everything

3152
02:28:22,240 --> 02:28:25,280
that I do is covered by and I paid for

3153
02:28:25,280 --> 02:28:26,439
it

3154
02:28:26,439 --> 02:28:28,880
myself. King Fisher Airlines was in no

3155
02:28:28,880 --> 02:28:31,439
position to

3156
02:28:31,880 --> 02:28:36,160
pay. I paid for it myself.

3157
02:28:36,160 --> 02:28:38,200
Maybe in hindsight

3158
02:28:38,200 --> 02:28:40,880
now, okay, and we're talking about

3159
02:28:40,880 --> 02:28:43,479
December

3160
02:28:43,479 --> 02:28:46,880
2015 against an airline that shut in

3161
02:28:46,880 --> 02:28:50,720
2012. Mhm. If you're talking about my

3162
02:28:50,720 --> 02:28:54,120
birthday party in December 18,

3163
02:28:54,120 --> 02:28:56,960
2012, you probably have a more

3164
02:28:56,960 --> 02:28:59,439
significant point.

3165
02:28:59,439 --> 02:29:01,160
But three years

3166
02:29:01,160 --> 02:29:04,840
later in December

3167
02:29:04,840 --> 02:29:09,080
2015, okay, a milestone 60th birthday,

3168
02:29:09,080 --> 02:29:12,800
right? Still being held against me with

3169
02:29:12,800 --> 02:29:16,319
such venom. I don't quite get it. But

3170
02:29:16,319 --> 02:29:19,280
okay, maybe it was a mistake. I should

3171
02:29:19,280 --> 02:29:21,200
have probably come here to London and

3172
02:29:21,200 --> 02:29:22,479
had my party and nobody would have

3173
02:29:22,479 --> 02:29:24,960
known. But once again because I was

3174
02:29:24,960 --> 02:29:27,439
transparent and lived my life pretty

3175
02:29:27,439 --> 02:29:29,920
transparently as I always did the media

3176
02:29:29,920 --> 02:29:32,840
latched on to it and bashed me for it.

3177
02:29:32,840 --> 02:29:36,720
Fine. So everything in the last 10 or 15

3178
02:29:36,720 --> 02:29:39,200
minutes maybe more that you are

3179
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:43,640
questioning me on are Indian media

3180
02:29:43,640 --> 02:29:47,439
generated comments and narratives. None

3181
02:29:47,439 --> 02:29:49,280
of these are facts. But are you not

3182
02:29:49,280 --> 02:29:50,880
apologetic about what happened?

3183
02:29:50,880 --> 02:29:54,840
Apologetic. What do I apologize for? For

3184
02:29:54,840 --> 02:29:58,080
only to the employ like only for the

3185
02:29:58,080 --> 02:29:59,920
employees of that business. For no one

3186
02:29:59,920 --> 02:30:02,640
else. After putting 3,000 crores of my

3187
02:30:02,640 --> 02:30:04,880
own money into the business, I need to

3188
02:30:04,880 --> 02:30:06,640
apologize.

3189
02:30:06,640 --> 02:30:10,000
You've been wronged, but so have your

3190
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:13,280
employees of King Fisher. What would you

3191
02:30:13,280 --> 02:30:16,240
say to them who lost their jobs, who

3192
02:30:16,240 --> 02:30:19,680
still hold angst against

3193
02:30:20,200 --> 02:30:22,479
you? If you were directly just talking

3194
02:30:22,479 --> 02:30:24,000
to them and not me, what would you tell

3195
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,080
them? I would say I'm deeply sorry for

3196
02:30:26,080 --> 02:30:27,399
what happened to

3197
02:30:27,399 --> 02:30:30,840
them, I would say, I'm deeply sorry

3198
02:30:30,840 --> 02:30:35,760
that some of them didn't get paid their

3199
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:40,439
salaries. I have no excuses to

3200
02:30:40,439 --> 02:30:44,120
offer. I take full

3201
02:30:44,120 --> 02:30:47,359
responsibility. But for those who care

3202
02:30:47,359 --> 02:30:49,080
to

3203
02:30:49,080 --> 02:30:50,840
listen, there

3204
02:30:50,840 --> 02:30:53,600
was money lying in deposit with the

3205
02:30:53,600 --> 02:30:55,000
Karnataka High

3206
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:58,880
Court. I specifically applied to court

3207
02:30:58,880 --> 02:31:01,880
to pay the salaries of King Shelline

3208
02:31:01,880 --> 02:31:05,040
staff. The banks objected and the court

3209
02:31:05,040 --> 02:31:06,920
refused the

3210
02:31:06,920 --> 02:31:10,000
permission. There was really nothing I

3211
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:13,200
could do beyond that. And what would you

3212
02:31:13,200 --> 02:31:14,720
tell those employees who are still

3213
02:31:14,720 --> 02:31:18,840
questioning that hey we were in

3214
02:31:18,840 --> 02:31:22,640
trouble and you tried everything to get

3215
02:31:22,640 --> 02:31:26,280
that money from the court but it didn't

3216
02:31:26,280 --> 02:31:30,479
help then why did you go out and party

3217
02:31:30,479 --> 02:31:32,560
like a king on your 60th birthday when

3218
02:31:32,560 --> 02:31:34,920
we were suffering

3219
02:31:34,920 --> 02:31:39,000
uh we need to look at the timeline

3220
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:42,439
here airlines shut down

3221
02:31:42,439 --> 02:31:49,120
2012. My 60th birthday was in December

3222
02:31:50,359 --> 02:31:53,520
2015. Right?

3223
02:31:53,520 --> 02:31:57,080
There was nothing I could do in the

3224
02:31:57,080 --> 02:32:01,439
interim to find money to pay the staff

3225
02:32:01,439 --> 02:32:03,160
in

3226
02:32:03,160 --> 02:32:06,800
particular because any money that could

3227
02:32:06,800 --> 02:32:09,520
have been infused theoretically would

3228
02:32:09,520 --> 02:32:11,080
have been taken by the

3229
02:32:11,080 --> 02:32:13,439
banks because all the assets were

3230
02:32:13,439 --> 02:32:16,160
frozen. Did your legal advise you not to

3231
02:32:16,160 --> 02:32:19,160
pay? Absolutely not. I told my legal

3232
02:32:19,160 --> 02:32:22,479
advisers to find every single avenue to

3233
02:32:22,479 --> 02:32:25,840
pay and they and it didn't work. They

3234
02:32:25,840 --> 02:32:27,439
couldn't find a way. But ultimately

3235
02:32:27,439 --> 02:32:29,000
because of the

3236
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,439
freezing all the money was lying under

3237
02:32:31,439 --> 02:32:33,200
the control of the court. So we couldn't

3238
02:32:33,200 --> 02:32:35,600
touch the money and every penny that you

3239
02:32:35,600 --> 02:32:36,960
would have infused just for their

3240
02:32:36,960 --> 02:32:38,479
intention to pay your employees would

3241
02:32:38,479 --> 02:32:40,960
have still gotten frozen. You see the

3242
02:32:40,960 --> 02:32:43,040
court order did not differentiate

3243
02:32:43,040 --> 02:32:45,880
between employees and general corporate

3244
02:32:45,880 --> 02:32:48,200
purposes.

3245
02:32:48,200 --> 02:32:52,240
Any money in the account of the airline

3246
02:32:52,240 --> 02:32:53,640
was

3247
02:32:53,640 --> 02:32:56,800
frozen. Frozen by the banks, frozen by

3248
02:32:56,800 --> 02:32:59,680
tax department, frozen by service tax.

3249
02:32:59,680 --> 02:33:00,680
Everything was

3250
02:33:00,680 --> 02:33:03,840
frozen. The chunk of available cash was

3251
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:05,920
with the court and that was actually

3252
02:33:05,920 --> 02:33:08,399
cash of UBHL,

3253
02:33:08,399 --> 02:33:11,280
not Kingfish Airlines cash of United

3254
02:33:11,280 --> 02:33:13,520
Breweries Holdings Limited, one of the

3255
02:33:13,520 --> 02:33:15,520
cogntos.

3256
02:33:15,520 --> 02:33:18,800
UBL said we want to pay King Fel and

3257
02:33:18,800 --> 02:33:22,080
staff salaries. Please allow us. The

3258
02:33:22,080 --> 02:33:24,720
banks objected and the court did not

3259
02:33:24,720 --> 02:33:28,640
give permission. That is

3260
02:33:28,680 --> 02:33:32,800
fact. They I I would feel very sad if

3261
02:33:32,800 --> 02:33:35,280
somebody said I had no intention to pay

3262
02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:39,520
or that I ignored to make the efforts. I

3263
02:33:39,520 --> 02:33:41,920
made every single effort I could. Are

3264
02:33:41,920 --> 02:33:44,479
you do you ever feel sorry that you

3265
02:33:44,479 --> 02:33:46,720
couldn't do anything to give money to

3266
02:33:46,720 --> 02:33:48,560
the employees?

3267
02:33:48,560 --> 02:33:49,720
Obviously,

3268
02:33:49,720 --> 02:33:54,479
but um are you suggesting

3269
02:33:54,520 --> 02:33:57,840
that I'm not sorry for what happened to

3270
02:33:57,840 --> 02:34:01,120
King Fischer and the collateral damage

3271
02:34:01,120 --> 02:34:04,160
that was caused to everybody?

3272
02:34:04,160 --> 02:34:05,720
I'm asking you, are

3273
02:34:05,720 --> 02:34:09,040
you? I said I was very sad about the

3274
02:34:09,040 --> 02:34:10,960
fact that the You were sad but were you

3275
02:34:10,960 --> 02:34:14,680
sorry about it?

3276
02:34:14,880 --> 02:34:18,319
Sorry. I apologize publicly to everyone

3277
02:34:18,319 --> 02:34:20,880
for the failure of King Fisher Airlines.

3278
02:34:20,880 --> 02:34:24,240
Till today I am willing to apologize. I

3279
02:34:24,240 --> 02:34:28,000
did my very best. I tried very very

3280
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:31,439
hard. I put in my money, blood, sweat,

3281
02:34:31,439 --> 02:34:34,479
and tears. It didn't work. Sadly, it

3282
02:34:34,479 --> 02:34:36,800
didn't work. I'm very sorry. At the end

3283
02:34:36,800 --> 02:34:37,960
of the day,

3284
02:34:37,960 --> 02:34:40,479
frankly, it's what I think of myself

3285
02:34:40,479 --> 02:34:42,240
when I look at myself in the mirror in

3286
02:34:42,240 --> 02:34:44,800
the morning. Have you done good or have

3287
02:34:44,800 --> 02:34:47,520
you not done good? Are you a success or

3288
02:34:47,520 --> 02:34:52,280
are you a failure? What is the answer?

3289
02:34:52,319 --> 02:34:55,880
I'm a big failure according to

3290
02:34:55,880 --> 02:34:59,359
Indians. Fine. I'm a big failure. But

3291
02:34:59,359 --> 02:35:01,520
when I look at myself in the mirror, I

3292
02:35:01,520 --> 02:35:03,600
don't see failure. But does it bother

3293
02:35:03,600 --> 02:35:04,640
you?

3294
02:35:04,640 --> 02:35:06,840
Who created

3295
02:35:06,840 --> 02:35:10,560
one.75 lakh cr of market cap in the in

3296
02:35:10,560 --> 02:35:13,399
the alcoholic

3297
02:35:13,399 --> 02:35:16,800
business? Who created it? Even after

3298
02:35:16,800 --> 02:35:19,120
creating such a behemoth, people think

3299
02:35:19,120 --> 02:35:20,880
you're a failed business owner. Fair

3300
02:35:20,880 --> 02:35:23,200
enough. So let Does it bother you? And

3301
02:35:23,200 --> 02:35:25,640
who made King Fisher Airlines so

3302
02:35:25,640 --> 02:35:30,120
public? Who made it?

3303
02:35:30,720 --> 02:35:33,399
Dammania airways started and

3304
02:35:33,399 --> 02:35:36,359
failed. East West Airlines started and

3305
02:35:36,359 --> 02:35:38,040
failed,

3306
02:35:38,040 --> 02:35:40,840
right? Jet Airways eventually

3307
02:35:40,840 --> 02:35:44,120
failed, right? Modilu started and

3308
02:35:44,120 --> 02:35:47,120
failed,

3309
02:35:47,479 --> 02:35:51,000
right? Paramount started and

3310
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,800
failed. You read about

3311
02:35:53,800 --> 02:35:57,960
them only King Fisher and

3312
02:35:57,960 --> 02:36:03,359
Malia. Is that not a targeted attack?

3313
02:36:03,359 --> 02:36:05,200
Because here's what got crafted after

3314
02:36:05,200 --> 02:36:08,880
it. Who crafted it? I'll tell you. I'll

3315
02:36:08,880 --> 02:36:11,760
come to that. Tell me then. So, tell me

3316
02:36:11,760 --> 02:36:13,920
what about all these other aviation

3317
02:36:13,920 --> 02:36:16,399
failures? See, nobody cares about them

3318
02:36:16,399 --> 02:36:19,920
because nobody was as public as you. Ah,

3319
02:36:19,920 --> 02:36:23,120
so now we're talking that I pay the

3320
02:36:23,120 --> 02:36:25,840
price for my own public image and the

3321
02:36:25,840 --> 02:36:28,399
fact that you left the country. Ah

3322
02:36:28,399 --> 02:36:31,600
that's which is another which is another

3323
02:36:31,600 --> 02:36:33,280
uh so I'll come to the series of events

3324
02:36:33,280 --> 02:36:38,200
of these both of them no problem okay

3325
02:36:38,359 --> 02:36:42,760
so 2015 December this happened before

3326
02:36:42,760 --> 02:36:46,880
that CBI started investigating you and I

3327
02:36:46,880 --> 02:36:50,520
appeared before the CBI four times h and

3328
02:36:50,520 --> 02:36:54,800
CBI concluded their case that they found

3329
02:36:54,800 --> 02:36:57,439
you siphoning the money was that the

3330
02:36:57,439 --> 02:37:00,160
completely false. Okay. There is no

3331
02:37:00,160 --> 02:37:03,439
allegation of money siphoning by CBI.

3332
02:37:03,439 --> 02:37:05,840
What did CBI conclude? Nothing. That I

3333
02:37:05,840 --> 02:37:08,000
spent on a private jet which was

3334
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,399
Kingfish Airlines own assets. Yeah. That

3335
02:37:10,399 --> 02:37:12,359
I misrepresented to

3336
02:37:12,359 --> 02:37:15,920
IDBI while taking the loan. Mhm. What

3337
02:37:15,920 --> 02:37:18,600
did you misrepresent? That I

3338
02:37:18,600 --> 02:37:21,200
misrepresented. Uh you asked me a

3339
02:37:21,200 --> 02:37:23,439
question about brand valuation, right?

3340
02:37:23,439 --> 02:37:25,520
So one of them one of the allegations

3341
02:37:25,520 --> 02:37:27,120
brand valuation. Was it also bizarre

3342
02:37:27,120 --> 02:37:30,479
like IDBI gave you loan in just 2 days

3343
02:37:30,479 --> 02:37:32,000
and on Sunday you got the money

3344
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:33,439
transferred in your bank. Yeah. But then

3345
02:37:33,439 --> 02:37:35,439
they that was a short-term loan. Okay.

3346
02:37:35,439 --> 02:37:37,920
They got the money back and then they

3347
02:37:37,920 --> 02:37:40,160
participated in the consortium lending.

3348
02:37:40,160 --> 02:37:42,240
Okay. Yeah. So but there is no

3349
02:37:42,240 --> 02:37:46,160
allegation of siphoning money. No. Zero.

3350
02:37:46,160 --> 02:37:48,319
So there was misrepresentation. Yeah.

3351
02:37:48,319 --> 02:37:50,560
That's and using that money or using the

3352
02:37:50,560 --> 02:37:52,080
Kingfisher loan proceedings to buy a

3353
02:37:52,080 --> 02:37:54,399
private jet. Not private jet was owned

3354
02:37:54,399 --> 02:37:57,280
by King

3355
02:37:58,280 --> 02:38:01,040
Airlines. The King Airlines own asset.

3356
02:38:01,040 --> 02:38:04,399
They said I misused it. I misused it for

3357
02:38:04,399 --> 02:38:06,319
personal trips.

3358
02:38:06,319 --> 02:38:08,280
Did

3359
02:38:08,280 --> 02:38:11,040
you? I think if you see the line of

3360
02:38:11,040 --> 02:38:13,560
private jets starting from Mr.

3361
02:38:13,560 --> 02:38:15,080
Aman's

3362
02:38:15,080 --> 02:38:17,920
in Bombay airport and ask them who uses

3363
02:38:17,920 --> 02:38:22,120
your jets, you'll get the answer.

3364
02:38:23,359 --> 02:38:26,399
Come on. Deflecting is not a right way.

3365
02:38:26,399 --> 02:38:29,120
Deflecting. I'm asking you. What? Did

3366
02:38:29,120 --> 02:38:33,280
you misuse it? What is misuse? I don't

3367
02:38:33,280 --> 02:38:35,280
know. Whatever they're quoting, do you

3368
02:38:35,280 --> 02:38:36,960
agree with it or no? So, you agree with

3369
02:38:36,960 --> 02:38:38,880
the CBI? No, I'm asking you. Do you

3370
02:38:38,880 --> 02:38:41,200
agree with it or not? I am not agree

3371
02:38:41,200 --> 02:38:43,920
with it. Obviously, I don't agree with

3372
02:38:43,920 --> 02:38:45,680
it. You used it for business purposes

3373
02:38:45,680 --> 02:38:46,960
only. What do you mean business

3374
02:38:46,960 --> 02:38:50,720
purposes? If I had to fly on holiday,

3375
02:38:50,720 --> 02:38:54,160
I'd say private

3376
02:38:57,800 --> 02:39:01,120
jet. That's what CB had problem with. Is

3377
02:39:01,120 --> 02:39:03,359
that the case? Yes. That you you you

3378
02:39:03,359 --> 02:39:05,840
took the Come on. That would not only be

3379
02:39:05,840 --> 02:39:08,560
the case. Huh? That would be a part of

3380
02:39:08,560 --> 02:39:10,240
your case. Let's say you This is what

3381
02:39:10,240 --> 02:39:12,479
I'm saying. The principle one was

3382
02:39:12,479 --> 02:39:14,399
misrepresentation.

3383
02:39:14,399 --> 02:39:16,680
Okay. Yeah. So that is first

3384
02:39:16,680 --> 02:39:19,359
misrepresentation and because of this

3385
02:39:19,359 --> 02:39:21,880
they issued an

3386
02:39:21,880 --> 02:39:24,319
LOC they issued LOC right lookout

3387
02:39:24,319 --> 02:39:27,439
circular to the immigration office that

3388
02:39:27,439 --> 02:39:29,359
should not leave the country no I'm not

3389
02:39:29,359 --> 02:39:31,920
aware of any of that okay because then

3390
02:39:31,920 --> 02:39:34,920
there was a public issuance against in

3391
02:39:34,920 --> 02:39:38,880
2015 where the LOC which was issued for

3392
02:39:38,880 --> 02:39:42,479
you had few words changed I know nothing

3393
02:39:42,479 --> 02:39:44,880
about this okay so there

3394
02:39:44,880 --> 02:39:46,680
And this I'm quoting

3395
02:39:46,680 --> 02:39:50,640
from again another article where I can

3396
02:39:50,640 --> 02:39:52,800
show you the article where it's I've

3397
02:39:52,800 --> 02:39:54,319
never heard of this before. Okay. So the

3398
02:39:54,319 --> 02:39:55,840
article said that you met with someone

3399
02:39:55,840 --> 02:39:58,319
really powerful and after that in just

3400
02:39:58,319 --> 02:40:00,800
few months the lookout circular got

3401
02:40:00,800 --> 02:40:02,880
changed and the lookout circular changed

3402
02:40:02,880 --> 02:40:05,120
into okay next time to the immigration

3403
02:40:05,120 --> 02:40:08,720
off officers that if Vijay Malia comes

3404
02:40:08,720 --> 02:40:10,520
to the airport and want to leave the

3405
02:40:10,520 --> 02:40:13,280
country you need to inform us where is

3406
02:40:13,280 --> 02:40:16,560
he going and for what purposes you don't

3407
02:40:16,560 --> 02:40:20,359
need to stop him but earlier the

3408
02:40:20,359 --> 02:40:23,520
CBI put out a lookout notice that you

3409
02:40:23,520 --> 02:40:25,200
should not allow Vijay Malia to leave

3410
02:40:25,200 --> 02:40:27,359
the country and this change was made in

3411
02:40:27,359 --> 02:40:30,399
2015. I know nothing about this. This is

3412
02:40:30,399 --> 02:40:32,800
the first time you are informing me. I

3413
02:40:32,800 --> 02:40:35,359
went in and out multiple times during

3414
02:40:35,359 --> 02:40:40,800
the never never a problem at

3415
02:40:41,240 --> 02:40:43,600
all and what you're telling me now is

3416
02:40:43,600 --> 02:40:45,000
news to

3417
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:50,080
me. I've never known of LOC issued or

3418
02:40:50,080 --> 02:40:51,920
any other form of notice. The changed

3419
02:40:51,920 --> 02:40:57,760
happened on 24th November 2015. Just few

3420
02:40:58,040 --> 02:41:01,680
words and it specifically read this was

3421
02:41:01,680 --> 02:41:03,840
a fresh LOC that he needs to be

3422
02:41:03,840 --> 02:41:05,200
questioned before leaving the country.

3423
02:41:05,200 --> 02:41:06,960
Where is he going and needs to and this

3424
02:41:06,960 --> 02:41:09,280
needs to be informed to CBI after that

3425
02:41:09,280 --> 02:41:10,720
he can continue traveling. He should not

3426
02:41:10,720 --> 02:41:13,439
be stopped. That's fine. that you said

3427
02:41:13,439 --> 02:41:15,760
when in 2015

3428
02:41:15,760 --> 02:41:19,600
24th November 2015 a fresh LOC was and

3429
02:41:19,600 --> 02:41:22,399
before that before that there was just I

3430
02:41:22,399 --> 02:41:24,399
don't have must have gone in four times

3431
02:41:24,399 --> 02:41:28,000
before that two oh so then where's the

3432
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:31,000
LOC

3433
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,640
so all of this is random thing that you

3434
02:41:34,640 --> 02:41:36,319
met someone really powerful in Delhi and

3435
02:41:36,319 --> 02:41:38,479
got changed and you changed your CBI

3436
02:41:38,479 --> 02:41:41,080
circular or something

3437
02:41:41,080 --> 02:41:44,720
nonsense Okay. Then another thing then

3438
02:41:44,720 --> 02:41:46,720
another series of event happened because

3439
02:41:46,720 --> 02:41:49,439
after your public birthday party people

3440
02:41:49,439 --> 02:41:51,200
started

3441
02:41:51,200 --> 02:41:52,800
uh losing their [Â __Â ] They started

3442
02:41:52,800 --> 02:41:55,439
getting they started getting pissed. It

3443
02:41:55,439 --> 02:41:59,120
became even more public. This 2015 end

3444
02:41:59,120 --> 02:42:00,359
of

3445
02:42:00,359 --> 02:42:04,080
it your Supreme Court interfered. I

3446
02:42:04,080 --> 02:42:07,439
guess Supreme Court entered in this

3447
02:42:07,439 --> 02:42:11,439
whole case and they put up a bench that

3448
02:42:11,439 --> 02:42:13,560
3rd March

3449
02:42:13,560 --> 02:42:15,160
2016

3450
02:42:15,160 --> 02:42:17,600
your case needs to be heard or needs to

3451
02:42:17,600 --> 02:42:19,479
be represented in front of Supreme

3452
02:42:19,479 --> 02:42:24,439
Court. On 1st March 2016,

3453
02:42:24,439 --> 02:42:27,680
you I think you were in Delhi, you went

3454
02:42:27,680 --> 02:42:30,240
to the parliament and 2nd March you left

3455
02:42:30,240 --> 02:42:34,160
the country one day before when you were

3456
02:42:34,160 --> 02:42:36,319
about to be present in front of Supreme

3457
02:42:36,319 --> 02:42:39,200
Court. Is all of this real or none of it

3458
02:42:39,200 --> 02:42:42,160
is real? No, no, this is completely

3459
02:42:42,160 --> 02:42:44,520
false. There was no Supreme Court

3460
02:42:44,520 --> 02:42:47,840
hearing. I was not summoned to court. I

3461
02:42:47,840 --> 02:42:50,960
I'm not aware of any court hearing.

3462
02:42:50,960 --> 02:42:55,240
I told the finance minister Arun

3463
02:42:55,240 --> 02:42:59,200
Jetley before leaving for the

3464
02:42:59,240 --> 02:43:03,680
airport and then I flew from Delhi to

3465
02:43:03,680 --> 02:43:06,319
London. I was on my way to Geneva for a

3466
02:43:06,319 --> 02:43:09,200
FIA world council meeting which was

3467
02:43:09,200 --> 02:43:12,800
fixed months ago. I told the finance

3468
02:43:12,800 --> 02:43:15,720
minister because I went from parliament

3469
02:43:15,720 --> 02:43:19,040
to Delhi

3470
02:43:19,560 --> 02:43:22,280
airport when this

3471
02:43:22,280 --> 02:43:25,760
news hit the

3472
02:43:27,800 --> 02:43:30,280
media once

3473
02:43:30,280 --> 02:43:33,840
again it created a storm.

3474
02:43:33,840 --> 02:43:39,520
Yeah. People went running to Mr. Jetley.

3475
02:43:39,520 --> 02:43:41,640
He denied meeting

3476
02:43:41,640 --> 02:43:46,479
me. A Congress MP saw us and then said

3477
02:43:46,479 --> 02:43:48,760
to the media, "No, I saw them

3478
02:43:48,760 --> 02:43:51,439
together." Mr. Jetley had to retract his

3479
02:43:51,439 --> 02:43:54,319
statement and yes, yes, I met him, but

3480
02:43:54,319 --> 02:43:56,520
only while I was walking. It was a

3481
02:43:56,520 --> 02:43:59,520
fleeting

3482
02:43:59,880 --> 02:44:02,800
meeting. I never said I went to Mr.

3483
02:44:02,800 --> 02:44:06,240
Jetley's office, sat in front of him,

3484
02:44:06,240 --> 02:44:08,479
had tea with him.

3485
02:44:08,479 --> 02:44:10,880
All I said is I told the finance

3486
02:44:10,880 --> 02:44:14,080
minister while leaving I'm going to

3487
02:44:14,080 --> 02:44:16,000
London. I have to go to Geneva for a

3488
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,560
meeting. I'll be back. Please tell the

3489
02:44:18,560 --> 02:44:20,720
banks to sit across the table and settle

3490
02:44:20,720 --> 02:44:23,600
with me. How long does this take this

3491
02:44:23,600 --> 02:44:29,000
one sentence? A minute or two.

3492
02:44:35,279 --> 02:44:39,040
But you see the way he denied it. Then

3493
02:44:39,040 --> 02:44:42,319
when the Congress MP pointed out his

3494
02:44:42,319 --> 02:44:45,800
mistake that he saw us, he quickly

3495
02:44:45,800 --> 02:44:48,520
changed. This is the problem with the

3496
02:44:48,520 --> 02:44:52,080
media. Particularly where I'm concerned.

3497
02:44:52,080 --> 02:44:54,479
They conjure up stuff. They blow things

3498
02:44:54,479 --> 02:44:55,800
well out of

3499
02:44:55,800 --> 02:44:58,000
proportion. Okay? If it's good for their

3500
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,720
business, let them continue doing it. So

3501
02:45:00,720 --> 02:45:05,200
all of this is nuisance that on 2nd of

3502
02:45:05,200 --> 02:45:09,439
March you left Delhi airport for London

3503
02:45:09,439 --> 02:45:13,600
in a jet airways flight 9W122 from T3

3504
02:45:13,600 --> 02:45:16,680
with 55 big

3505
02:45:16,680 --> 02:45:19,359
suitcases and somebody says 27, somebody

3506
02:45:19,359 --> 02:45:21,600
says 55. I mean different newspapers,

3507
02:45:21,600 --> 02:45:23,080
different

3508
02:45:23,080 --> 02:45:26,880
stuff. What difference does it make?

3509
02:45:26,880 --> 02:45:29,920
They say LOC then they say no LOC then I

3510
02:45:29,920 --> 02:45:31,680
tell the finance minister I'm going then

3511
02:45:31,680 --> 02:45:33,680
he says no then he says no he had a

3512
02:45:33,680 --> 02:45:35,479
fleeting meeting with

3513
02:45:35,479 --> 02:45:40,479
me and all this 15 18 suitcases were

3514
02:45:40,479 --> 02:45:43,359
complete and utter rubbish. So your

3515
02:45:43,359 --> 02:45:44,960
intention was never to leave the

3516
02:45:44,960 --> 02:45:46,520
country.

3517
02:45:46,520 --> 02:45:49,600
Look please understand this whole

3518
02:45:49,600 --> 02:45:52,720
narrative of Bhagya Bhaga because this

3519
02:45:52,720 --> 02:45:55,960
is where it starts. Yeah,

3520
02:45:55,960 --> 02:45:58,319
this is coming from people who don't

3521
02:45:58,319 --> 02:46:02,760
know their facts. Tell us the facts.

3522
02:46:02,760 --> 02:46:06,200
I came to England in

3523
02:46:06,200 --> 02:46:09,359
1988. I got my indefinite leave to

3524
02:46:09,359 --> 02:46:14,520
remain ILR in 1992.

3525
02:46:15,040 --> 02:46:18,479
For 32 years, I have been a permanent

3526
02:46:18,479 --> 02:46:20,600
resident of the

3527
02:46:20,600 --> 02:46:24,359
UK allowed only to spend 180 days in

3528
02:46:24,359 --> 02:46:27,240
India because I have preserved my

3529
02:46:27,240 --> 02:46:31,600
non-resident status since 1988.

3530
02:46:31,600 --> 02:46:33,840
All right, that is why I used to go back

3531
02:46:33,840 --> 02:46:35,160
and forth so

3532
02:46:35,160 --> 02:46:37,000
often. All

3533
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:40,880
right. So I came I was attending a

3534
02:46:40,880 --> 02:46:43,240
scheduled meeting in Geneva like I told

3535
02:46:43,240 --> 02:46:47,520
you. What happened? The loudest anchor

3536
02:46:47,520 --> 02:46:49,000
in the television

3537
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,560
industry

3538
02:46:51,560 --> 02:46:55,000
started all the media piled

3539
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:59,439
on. Huge hungama. How did Vijay Mala

3540
02:46:59,439 --> 02:47:03,200
leave? How did he leave? like any normal

3541
02:47:03,200 --> 02:47:06,800
person on a jet airways

3542
02:47:08,040 --> 02:47:10,560
flight that too after telling the

3543
02:47:10,560 --> 02:47:12,520
finance minister that I'm

3544
02:47:12,520 --> 02:47:15,600
going driving from parliament house to

3545
02:47:15,600 --> 02:47:16,840
the

3546
02:47:16,840 --> 02:47:19,800
airport right so this whole tamasha

3547
02:47:19,800 --> 02:47:23,080
started right how does

3548
02:47:23,080 --> 02:47:26,279
government normally react to media

3549
02:47:26,279 --> 02:47:28,600
frenzy check your own

3550
02:47:28,600 --> 02:47:32,960
facts I said okay let things cool

3551
02:47:32,960 --> 02:47:34,439
On top of

3552
02:47:34,439 --> 02:47:36,040
that,

3553
02:47:36,040 --> 02:47:38,800
I was negotiating with my foreign

3554
02:47:38,800 --> 02:47:41,840
collaborators to sell certain shares so

3555
02:47:41,840 --> 02:47:44,319
that I could pay the banks. My intention

3556
02:47:44,319 --> 02:47:46,600
was always to settle with the

3557
02:47:46,600 --> 02:47:49,760
banks. Right. Yeah. So, I told I wrote

3558
02:47:49,760 --> 02:47:51,520
to the enforcement directorate who sent

3559
02:47:51,520 --> 02:47:53,840
me a summon. I need some time. I'm

3560
02:47:53,840 --> 02:47:55,439
negotiating. I want to settle with the

3561
02:47:55,439 --> 02:47:57,439
banks. I've got some business to do.

3562
02:47:57,439 --> 02:48:00,000
I've already appeared before the CBI. I

3563
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,760
will of course I will appear before you.

3564
02:48:02,760 --> 02:48:06,080
Right. Just give me some time. What

3565
02:48:06,080 --> 02:48:07,439
happened in the meantime? They revoked

3566
02:48:07,439 --> 02:48:08,760
my

3567
02:48:08,760 --> 02:48:12,560
passport. Revoked it.

3568
02:48:12,560 --> 02:48:16,319
When When was this revoking? 2016. Oh,

3569
02:48:16,319 --> 02:48:19,040
right before you left.

3570
02:48:19,040 --> 02:48:21,600
Before. Right after you left. Yeah.

3571
02:48:21,600 --> 02:48:26,359
Passport gone. How to travel?

3572
02:48:29,920 --> 02:48:31,439
So you got stuck because they revoked

3573
02:48:31,439 --> 02:48:33,040
your passport. Your intention was to

3574
02:48:33,040 --> 02:48:34,359
come back to

3575
02:48:34,359 --> 02:48:36,560
country. Many things may have been

3576
02:48:36,560 --> 02:48:39,600
different. No. But your intention was

3577
02:48:39,600 --> 02:48:41,120
without without a passport. Where do you

3578
02:48:41,120 --> 02:48:46,319
go? Nowhere. Correct.

3579
02:48:46,319 --> 02:48:48,560
Because you were a British citizen. Not

3580
02:48:48,560 --> 02:48:50,319
citizen. Permanent res. Permanent

3581
02:48:50,319 --> 02:48:52,479
resident. I kept my Indian passport

3582
02:48:52,479 --> 02:48:54,560
because I was a member of parliament.

3583
02:48:54,560 --> 02:48:56,800
Okay. which I could not be a member of

3584
02:48:56,800 --> 02:48:58,960
parliament had I not been an Indian

3585
02:48:58,960 --> 02:49:01,520
citizen.

3586
02:49:01,520 --> 02:49:03,439
So if your intention was to come back to

3587
02:49:03,439 --> 02:49:08,000
the country why didn't people allow you

3588
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:11,439
look that you should ask the

3589
02:49:12,040 --> 02:49:15,680
people why should I sit and speculate

3590
02:49:15,680 --> 02:49:18,399
but aren't they spending millions of

3591
02:49:18,399 --> 02:49:22,000
dollars in cases to get your extradition

3592
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:23,840
done?

3593
02:49:23,840 --> 02:49:26,160
Yes. because they have to make a show of

3594
02:49:26,160 --> 02:49:28,520
things as well.

3595
02:49:28,520 --> 02:49:30,279
No, have

3596
02:49:30,279 --> 02:49:31,960
I

3597
02:49:31,960 --> 02:49:34,600
please? Let's be very

3598
02:49:34,600 --> 02:49:37,399
clear. Can

3599
02:49:37,399 --> 02:49:40,279
somebody from the

3600
02:49:40,279 --> 02:49:44,000
government say to the public, "What

3601
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,880
crime have I committed for which I must

3602
02:49:46,880 --> 02:49:49,040
be

3603
02:49:49,800 --> 02:49:51,920
investigated? Have I stolen money from

3604
02:49:51,920 --> 02:49:54,240
the banks?

3605
02:49:54,240 --> 02:49:56,399
You must have a primacy case that I've

3606
02:49:56,399 --> 02:49:58,000
stolen. You can't just make it up in

3607
02:49:58,000 --> 02:49:59,840
your head. Yeah. That I've stolen money

3608
02:49:59,840 --> 02:50:02,319
from the banks. You need some primacy

3609
02:50:02,319 --> 02:50:05,279
evidence.

3610
02:50:05,279 --> 02:50:08,479
Have I done any money

3611
02:50:09,240 --> 02:50:12,920
laundering? Have I done any drug

3612
02:50:12,920 --> 02:50:16,000
smuggling? Have I been involved in any

3613
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,600
violent crime?

3614
02:50:18,600 --> 02:50:20,120
What

3615
02:50:20,120 --> 02:50:24,880
is the allegation against Vijay

3616
02:50:25,560 --> 02:50:28,800
Mallaya? Nobody can have an allegation

3617
02:50:28,800 --> 02:50:31,439
against Vijay Mallaya of dishonesty

3618
02:50:31,439 --> 02:50:33,760
because I have always been honest and

3619
02:50:33,760 --> 02:50:36,359
truthful. I have never

3620
02:50:36,359 --> 02:50:39,359
borrowed and I have never cheated and I

3621
02:50:39,359 --> 02:50:41,520
never will.

3622
02:50:41,520 --> 02:50:43,279
But you got this tag of willful

3623
02:50:43,279 --> 02:50:46,520
defaulter. Willful defaulter is a

3624
02:50:46,520 --> 02:50:50,000
person who can pay and who doesn't pay.

3625
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:51,720
That's a

3626
02:50:51,720 --> 02:50:55,040
crime. That's

3627
02:50:55,319 --> 02:50:59,000
crime, isn't it? Make up your

3628
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:02,359
mind. Then why did you freeze all my

3629
02:51:02,359 --> 02:51:05,560
assets? You froze my

3630
02:51:05,560 --> 02:51:09,880
assets. Okay. In 2016,

3631
02:51:09,880 --> 02:51:12,359
right? That's how you've recovered

3632
02:51:12,359 --> 02:51:15,680
14,100 crores,

3633
02:51:15,720 --> 02:51:18,359
right? You can't freeze

3634
02:51:18,359 --> 02:51:21,000
assets of a

3635
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:23,760
person on one hand and call him a chore

3636
02:51:23,760 --> 02:51:27,120
on the other hand. See, they call you

3637
02:51:27,120 --> 02:51:31,600
willful defaulter because you had money

3638
02:51:31,600 --> 02:51:34,880
and you didn't pay. And that's why they

3639
02:51:34,880 --> 02:51:36,880
had to take such a strict action to

3640
02:51:36,880 --> 02:51:39,040
freeze your assets. If you would have

3641
02:51:39,040 --> 02:51:41,840
paid earlier then they would have not

3642
02:51:41,840 --> 02:51:43,680
done this. But if you're saying that

3643
02:51:43,680 --> 02:51:46,080
from 2012 to 2015 you have applied

3644
02:51:46,080 --> 02:51:48,160
multiple times in the court that you

3645
02:51:48,160 --> 02:51:50,960
want to settle. Yes.

3646
02:51:50,960 --> 02:51:54,479
Why is all of this

3647
02:51:55,720 --> 02:51:58,399
happening? I think it's very clear it's

3648
02:51:58,399 --> 02:52:01,680
also been a part of the media where a

3649
02:52:01,680 --> 02:52:04,160
particular senior officer of the state

3650
02:52:04,160 --> 02:52:07,040
bank of India said to a good friend of

3651
02:52:07,040 --> 02:52:09,680
mine that as a banker I would have

3652
02:52:09,680 --> 02:52:12,319
settled with Vijay a long time ago but

3653
02:52:12,319 --> 02:52:15,200
if I do any settlement with him I'll

3654
02:52:15,200 --> 02:52:19,439
have the CBI on my neck the very next

3655
02:52:21,640 --> 02:52:24,319
day. And why do you think CBI has to do

3656
02:52:24,319 --> 02:52:25,319
all of these

3657
02:52:25,319 --> 02:52:27,600
things? Because technically banks,

3658
02:52:27,600 --> 02:52:30,640
you're saying banks want 14,000 cr.

3659
02:52:30,640 --> 02:52:35,319
Isn't the CBI called a cage parrot?

3660
02:52:36,479 --> 02:52:38,560
But then banks ultimately want 14,000

3661
02:52:38,560 --> 02:52:41,640
cr. So they don't want anything to

3662
02:52:41,640 --> 02:52:44,080
happen. Why would bank want to settle?

3663
02:52:44,080 --> 02:52:46,800
Who knows? Who knows? If you go to the

3664
02:52:46,800 --> 02:52:49,040
banks today, they may tell you I owe

3665
02:52:49,040 --> 02:52:51,680
even more money. Tell me real numbers

3666
02:52:51,680 --> 02:52:53,520
because somewhere it's written 9,000 K

3667
02:52:53,520 --> 02:52:54,720
or somewhere it's written there is no

3668
02:52:54,720 --> 02:52:56,600
9,000 that is all

3669
02:52:56,600 --> 02:52:58,359
imagination

3670
02:52:58,359 --> 02:53:03,080
6203 is the real number judgment debt

3671
02:53:03,080 --> 02:53:05,760
6203 6,23

3672
02:53:05,760 --> 02:53:07,760
and you have been vocal about it I was

3673
02:53:07,760 --> 02:53:10,160
going through your tweets publicly you

3674
02:53:10,160 --> 02:53:12,560
have been very vocal about that hey I

3675
02:53:12,560 --> 02:53:14,640
want to pay come talk to me hey I want

3676
02:53:14,640 --> 02:53:16,640
to settle there are multiple times

3677
02:53:16,640 --> 02:53:18,479
you've just said it I have show you

3678
02:53:18,479 --> 02:53:20,319
letters I've written to the banks

3679
02:53:20,319 --> 02:53:23,200
nothing we cannot engage with you period

3680
02:53:23,200 --> 02:53:25,439
right you were part of the parliament

3681
02:53:25,439 --> 02:53:29,120
Mhm. And you had you were influential.

3682
02:53:29,120 --> 02:53:30,840
You had money. You were

3683
02:53:30,840 --> 02:53:33,200
powerful. You could do nothing about all

3684
02:53:33,200 --> 02:53:35,359
of

3685
02:53:36,439 --> 02:53:39,319
this. What went

3686
02:53:39,319 --> 02:53:42,880
wrong? That probably is the cause of

3687
02:53:42,880 --> 02:53:45,520
everything that

3688
02:53:46,359 --> 02:53:49,840
followed. Who do you make a poster boy?

3689
02:53:49,840 --> 02:53:52,960
Somebody who is insignificant. Is it?

3690
02:53:52,960 --> 02:53:54,640
Why would if you want to if you want to

3691
02:53:54,640 --> 02:53:56,640
make an example of somebody who do you

3692
02:53:56,640 --> 02:53:59,920
make an example of a visible person or

3693
02:53:59,920 --> 02:54:01,680
an invisible person? Definitely a

3694
02:54:01,680 --> 02:54:03,359
visible person. Correct. So there you

3695
02:54:03,359 --> 02:54:05,520
have got the answer. But why would they

3696
02:54:05,520 --> 02:54:07,040
want to make an example out of you when

3697
02:54:07,040 --> 02:54:09,200
you were ready to settle? It was just a

3698
02:54:09,200 --> 02:54:10,800
business failure in your terms. It it

3699
02:54:10,800 --> 02:54:13,600
suits you no to reject a settlement

3700
02:54:13,600 --> 02:54:16,800
offer and to continue to claim that

3701
02:54:16,800 --> 02:54:19,439
amounts are due to the banks and you

3702
02:54:19,439 --> 02:54:20,880
therefore you're a defaulter and

3703
02:54:20,880 --> 02:54:22,479
therefore we are going to hound you and

3704
02:54:22,479 --> 02:54:23,319
chase

3705
02:54:23,319 --> 02:54:25,720
you. It suits the

3706
02:54:25,720 --> 02:54:28,040
narrative today in

3707
02:54:28,040 --> 02:54:33,319
India business failure means fraud.

3708
02:54:33,840 --> 02:54:36,080
If purely that line you're talking about

3709
02:54:36,080 --> 02:54:38,439
asking me about

3710
02:54:38,439 --> 02:54:41,000
me, why

3711
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:44,160
people tag me woolful defaulter? Why

3712
02:54:44,160 --> 02:54:47,680
they accuse me? Why the narrative is so

3713
02:54:47,680 --> 02:54:50,240
negative about me? What happened to poor

3714
02:54:50,240 --> 02:54:53,319
Nar Goyel? What

3715
02:54:53,319 --> 02:54:56,080
happened? India's biggest airlines jet

3716
02:54:56,080 --> 02:55:00,760
collapsed. Naresh Goyel went to jail.

3717
02:55:00,800 --> 02:55:03,359
What happened to people like Gautam

3718
02:55:03,359 --> 02:55:05,399
Tapur in

3719
02:55:05,399 --> 02:55:09,920
Delhi in jail?

3720
02:55:10,520 --> 02:55:14,479
Right? So if your business does badly,

3721
02:55:14,479 --> 02:55:16,760
you're automatically referred to as a

3722
02:55:16,760 --> 02:55:20,840
fraud. The inference is that you have

3723
02:55:20,840 --> 02:55:23,279
stolen. In which countries does this

3724
02:55:23,279 --> 02:55:26,080
happen?

3725
02:55:26,080 --> 02:55:28,439
The biggest companies in the world

3726
02:55:28,439 --> 02:55:30,840
fail, right? Are

3727
02:55:30,840 --> 02:55:32,880
there their management, senior

3728
02:55:32,880 --> 02:55:34,279
management put in

3729
02:55:34,279 --> 02:55:37,319
jail? Are they accused of

3730
02:55:37,319 --> 02:55:41,479
fraud? The whole purpose of

3731
02:55:41,479 --> 02:55:44,399
business is associated with certain risk

3732
02:55:44,399 --> 02:55:48,920
as well. Y right.

3733
02:55:49,439 --> 02:55:54,160
But in India, sadly, you have a business

3734
02:55:54,160 --> 02:55:55,560
that

3735
02:55:55,560 --> 02:55:58,880
fails. You're accused of fraud and

3736
02:55:58,880 --> 02:56:02,520
improper conduct.

3737
02:56:06,479 --> 02:56:08,720
And people say and the government and

3738
02:56:08,720 --> 02:56:11,520
the agencies

3739
02:56:11,640 --> 02:56:15,359
that your fraud or people who are

3740
02:56:15,359 --> 02:56:17,399
businesses have failed are

3741
02:56:17,399 --> 02:56:20,960
fraud because they've taken money from

3742
02:56:20,960 --> 02:56:23,439
the banks which is a common taxpayers

3743
02:56:23,439 --> 02:56:26,640
money which is common people's money. So

3744
02:56:26,640 --> 02:56:28,319
if you take common people's money and

3745
02:56:28,319 --> 02:56:30,399
you're not able to repay it then you're

3746
02:56:30,399 --> 02:56:31,880
considered

3747
02:56:31,880 --> 02:56:36,560
wrong. But if in your case if they have

3748
02:56:36,560 --> 02:56:39,439
actually recovered more than 2.5x of it

3749
02:56:39,439 --> 02:56:41,560
or probably somewhere around that

3750
02:56:41,560 --> 02:56:44,080
number why are they still behind you?

3751
02:56:44,080 --> 02:56:45,479
Because as I

3752
02:56:45,479 --> 02:56:48,920
said, have you ever

3753
02:56:48,920 --> 02:56:52,800
heard of

3754
02:56:53,160 --> 02:56:55,240
any

3755
02:56:55,240 --> 02:56:59,439
bank not rendering an account to a

3756
02:56:59,439 --> 02:57:01,800
borrower or a

3757
02:57:01,800 --> 02:57:05,000
guaranter? Despite 15

3758
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,399
reminders, the same

3759
02:57:07,399 --> 02:57:10,880
banks have not given me a statement of

3760
02:57:10,880 --> 02:57:15,040
account. Not one. Have you ever heard of

3761
02:57:15,040 --> 02:57:18,399
such conduct anywhere in the world? For

3762
02:57:18,399 --> 02:57:19,560
the first

3763
02:57:19,560 --> 02:57:22,600
time, it is through the statement in

3764
02:57:22,600 --> 02:57:25,160
parliament of the finance

3765
02:57:25,160 --> 02:57:29,359
minister and the printed report of the

3766
02:57:29,359 --> 02:57:30,600
ministry of

3767
02:57:30,600 --> 02:57:33,920
finance that they have shown 14,100

3768
02:57:33,920 --> 02:57:36,800
crores recovered from me. The government

3769
02:57:36,800 --> 02:57:38,960
have the banks have not rendered a

3770
02:57:38,960 --> 02:57:41,600
statement of account. That is why I have

3771
02:57:41,600 --> 02:57:45,120
gone to the Karnataka High Court asking

3772
02:57:45,120 --> 02:57:48,479
the court to direct the banks to give me

3773
02:57:48,479 --> 02:57:50,880
a statement of account. That is the

3774
02:57:50,880 --> 02:57:54,000
pitiful state of affairs. Now let me

3775
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:56,319
explain things to you very in a summary

3776
02:57:56,319 --> 02:57:59,120
fashion in this entire debt of

3777
02:57:59,120 --> 02:58:02,000
Kingfisher Airlines and the recovery.

3778
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:05,200
You have the recovery officer of the

3779
02:58:05,200 --> 02:58:08,080
debt recovery tribunal. Yeah. The debt

3780
02:58:08,080 --> 02:58:11,760
recovery tribunal is the one that that

3781
02:58:11,760 --> 02:58:15,200
that gave the certificate of debt. They

3782
02:58:15,200 --> 02:58:18,720
have recovery officers whose job it is

3783
02:58:18,720 --> 02:58:20,840
to recover against that recovery

3784
02:58:20,840 --> 02:58:23,680
certificate and inform the tribunal

3785
02:58:23,680 --> 02:58:25,840
about how much has been recovered

3786
02:58:25,840 --> 02:58:27,399
because when the full amount is

3787
02:58:27,399 --> 02:58:30,000
recovered the debt recovery tribunal

3788
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:32,960
will issue a discharge certificate that

3789
02:58:32,960 --> 02:58:37,040
your debt is paid. Second is because the

3790
02:58:37,040 --> 02:58:38,960
second guarantor United Breweries

3791
02:58:38,960 --> 02:58:40,840
Holdings Limited is in

3792
02:58:40,840 --> 02:58:43,200
liquidation. It is in the control of the

3793
02:58:43,200 --> 02:58:44,200
official

3794
02:58:44,200 --> 02:58:46,800
liquidator. The official liquidator is

3795
02:58:46,800 --> 02:58:49,800
also obliged to give an account to the

3796
02:58:49,800 --> 02:58:54,600
court right on the liquidation which

3797
02:58:54,600 --> 02:58:57,600
includes being a co-arer of the king

3798
02:58:57,600 --> 02:59:01,000
fisher airlines debt

3799
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:03,240
right both

3800
02:59:03,240 --> 02:59:07,439
these have stated in court in judicial

3801
02:59:07,439 --> 02:59:09,520
proceedings that the banks have been

3802
02:59:09,520 --> 02:59:10,760
fully

3803
02:59:10,760 --> 02:59:14,720
paid yet the banks have not submitted a

3804
02:59:14,720 --> 02:59:17,120
statement of account. I have had to go

3805
02:59:17,120 --> 02:59:19,080
to the Karnataka High

3806
02:59:19,080 --> 02:59:21,840
Court pleading with them to please

3807
02:59:21,840 --> 02:59:24,160
direct the banks to submit a statement

3808
02:59:24,160 --> 02:59:26,560
of account and of course the official

3809
02:59:26,560 --> 02:59:28,880
liquidator and the recovery officer as

3810
02:59:28,880 --> 02:59:32,080
well. This is the conduct of those banks

3811
02:59:32,080 --> 02:59:34,240
and you're asking me questions about why

3812
02:59:34,240 --> 02:59:35,760
they didn't do this and why they didn't

3813
02:59:35,760 --> 02:59:38,000
do that. Does it happen with other

3814
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:39,920
entrepreneurs as well? I'd be shocked if

3815
02:59:39,920 --> 02:59:41,920
it did. I've never heard of anything

3816
02:59:41,920 --> 02:59:44,760
like this. Do you think the Indian

3817
02:59:44,760 --> 02:59:47,520
system gets rigged against the

3818
02:59:47,520 --> 02:59:49,200
entrepreneurs or the business owners who

3819
02:59:49,200 --> 02:59:52,080
get too powerful after a point? It's

3820
02:59:52,080 --> 02:59:54,720
certainly rigable because in your case,

3821
02:59:54,720 --> 02:59:57,200
this is what happened, right?

3822
02:59:57,200 --> 02:59:59,720
In my case, all the

3823
02:59:59,720 --> 03:00:03,279
facts are there for everyone to see.

3824
03:00:03,279 --> 03:00:05,760
Then sir, what's the future? Like what

3825
03:00:05,760 --> 03:00:07,880
what's going to happen now? What's

3826
03:00:07,880 --> 03:00:11,439
happening in your story?

3827
03:00:11,439 --> 03:00:13,840
What you're telling is completely

3828
03:00:13,840 --> 03:00:16,680
different than anything and everything

3829
03:00:16,680 --> 03:00:20,000
that any Indian person out there who

3830
03:00:20,000 --> 03:00:21,600
will do little research about you would

3831
03:00:21,600 --> 03:00:22,880
find. It's completely different than

3832
03:00:22,880 --> 03:00:25,200
what you're telling. But if you do

3833
03:00:25,200 --> 03:00:27,920
research on me, what are you going to

3834
03:00:27,920 --> 03:00:29,920
find?

3835
03:00:29,920 --> 03:00:32,760
You will only find the

3836
03:00:32,760 --> 03:00:35,600
narrative generated over a period of

3837
03:00:35,600 --> 03:00:40,720
time by the Indian legacy media and to

3838
03:00:40,720 --> 03:00:42,680
certain extent the

3839
03:00:42,680 --> 03:00:45,240
government and what they have

3840
03:00:45,240 --> 03:00:48,479
said and of course when I say government

3841
03:00:48,479 --> 03:00:50,880
it includes CBI and ED and this that and

3842
03:00:50,880 --> 03:00:52,960
the other. All right, that's all you

3843
03:00:52,960 --> 03:00:53,640
will

3844
03:00:53,640 --> 03:00:57,640
find. All of which is false

3845
03:00:57,640 --> 03:01:00,600
narrative either deliberately

3846
03:01:00,600 --> 03:01:04,800
written or in some cases with the media

3847
03:01:04,800 --> 03:01:08,279
ignorately written. So is there a

3848
03:01:08,279 --> 03:01:11,600
businessman, politician, media kind of

3849
03:01:11,600 --> 03:01:15,520
nexus against you in India? I don't know

3850
03:01:15,520 --> 03:01:19,319
who is against me except this

3851
03:01:19,319 --> 03:01:22,160
government and I made no bones about it

3852
03:01:22,160 --> 03:01:25,760
that I am their poster boy. I am also a

3853
03:01:25,760 --> 03:01:28,760
political football,

3854
03:01:28,760 --> 03:01:31,960
right? You must have heard the the

3855
03:01:31,960 --> 03:01:37,080
narrative. BJP tells Congressw.

3856
03:01:37,399 --> 03:01:40,250
Congress responds to

3857
03:01:40,250 --> 03:01:43,290
[Music]

3858
03:01:44,120 --> 03:01:47,720
BJP is the football in the

3859
03:01:47,720 --> 03:01:51,520
middle. What is the biggest challenge of

3860
03:01:51,520 --> 03:01:53,840
doing business in India?

3861
03:01:53,840 --> 03:01:56,479
government

3862
03:01:56,479 --> 03:01:58,760
extreme government it's in the Indian

3863
03:01:58,760 --> 03:02:02,240
DNA no matter what a state government or

3864
03:02:02,240 --> 03:02:04,720
a federal government may say about ease

3865
03:02:04,720 --> 03:02:07,359
of doing business in India there is no

3866
03:02:07,359 --> 03:02:10,319
ease of doing business in India there

3867
03:02:10,319 --> 03:02:13,200
are hurdles bureaucratic hurdles

3868
03:02:13,200 --> 03:02:15,600
political hurdles all along the way they

3869
03:02:15,600 --> 03:02:18,960
may have reduced over a period of time

3870
03:02:18,960 --> 03:02:22,000
uh but but no I mean you can't compare

3871
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:23,920
India and ease of doing business in

3872
03:02:23,920 --> 03:02:28,720
India with any of the western economies.

3873
03:02:28,720 --> 03:02:31,600
But how did you manage that before? Like

3874
03:02:31,600 --> 03:02:33,760
earlier you expanded your group from

3875
03:02:33,760 --> 03:02:36,680
couple of hundred crores to thousands of

3876
03:02:36,680 --> 03:02:39,120
critically you must be navigating

3877
03:02:39,120 --> 03:02:40,960
somehow with all these challenges. What

3878
03:02:40,960 --> 03:02:43,760
did you do? That's what I said. I I had

3879
03:02:43,760 --> 03:02:48,560
to maintain good relations with almost

3880
03:02:48,560 --> 03:02:52,399
29 countries. That's a 29 states all of

3881
03:02:52,399 --> 03:02:55,600
which were empowered by the constitution

3882
03:02:55,600 --> 03:02:58,560
to have their own policy on liquor. So I

3883
03:02:58,560 --> 03:03:00,560
had to effectively be in the good books

3884
03:03:00,560 --> 03:03:03,560
of 29 chief ministers. What do you mean

3885
03:03:03,560 --> 03:03:06,240
by becoming or getting in the good books

3886
03:03:06,240 --> 03:03:07,920
of the government? Well, you know, like

3887
03:03:07,920 --> 03:03:09,520
were you doing favors? They were asking

3888
03:03:09,520 --> 03:03:11,439
favors to you.

3889
03:03:11,439 --> 03:03:13,160
Look, let me tell

3890
03:03:13,160 --> 03:03:17,800
you when elections were announced, I

3891
03:03:17,800 --> 03:03:20,880
would desperately want to take a holiday

3892
03:03:20,880 --> 03:03:24,000
outside India. Why? Because I didn't

3893
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:26,880
want to be accessible. The politicians

3894
03:03:26,880 --> 03:03:30,640
always felt that you know the liquor

3895
03:03:30,640 --> 03:03:34,000
business was the cash cow that would

3896
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:37,240
meet their electoral aspirations. um you

3897
03:03:37,240 --> 03:03:41,200
know sometimes these aspirations were

3898
03:03:41,200 --> 03:03:43,479
completely unreasonable and

3899
03:03:43,479 --> 03:03:46,359
impractical but no I mean

3900
03:03:46,359 --> 03:03:50,040
look dealing with government doesn't

3901
03:03:50,040 --> 03:03:54,920
mean underhand exchange of

3902
03:03:54,920 --> 03:03:58,240
money okay it definitely doesn't I mean

3903
03:03:58,240 --> 03:04:00,880
whoever said that you know I can buy my

3904
03:04:00,880 --> 03:04:04,319
way through X Y or Z is wrong okay you

3905
03:04:04,319 --> 03:04:07,680
can have good relations with people and

3906
03:04:07,680 --> 03:04:11,120
provided you present

3907
03:04:11,120 --> 03:04:14,399
um a proposal to them that meets their

3908
03:04:14,399 --> 03:04:17,520
own political objectives, it works well.

3909
03:04:17,520 --> 03:04:20,000
But would there ever be exchange under

3910
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:21,680
the table as well? All of that used to

3911
03:04:21,680 --> 03:04:23,160
work. No, you

3912
03:04:23,160 --> 03:04:26,080
know, I'm not going to confirm or deny

3913
03:04:26,080 --> 03:04:27,960
that because I leave it to your

3914
03:04:27,960 --> 03:04:30,080
imagination because I think you know

3915
03:04:30,080 --> 03:04:32,520
India as much as I know

3916
03:04:32,520 --> 03:04:36,520
India and

3917
03:04:37,200 --> 03:04:40,080
They would ask for backing the election

3918
03:04:40,080 --> 03:04:42,000
campaigns. That's what they would ask

3919
03:04:42,000 --> 03:04:43,840
technically. Or were there was there

3920
03:04:43,840 --> 03:04:45,120
something else as well? Look, the

3921
03:04:45,120 --> 03:04:48,240
demands were varied. Give me give me

3922
03:04:48,240 --> 03:04:49,680
example of two three demands. The

3923
03:04:49,680 --> 03:04:52,399
demands were first of all cash. Second

3924
03:04:52,399 --> 03:04:55,439
copious amounts of alcohol which is

3925
03:04:55,439 --> 03:04:57,760
seems to be an essential part of any

3926
03:04:57,760 --> 03:05:02,319
electoral campaign for free. Vehicles.

3927
03:05:02,319 --> 03:05:05,640
Vehicles. Cars. vehicles, jeeps, cars.

3928
03:05:05,640 --> 03:05:09,000
Yeah. So it was

3929
03:05:09,000 --> 03:05:12,560
multifarious but the easiest for me was

3930
03:05:12,560 --> 03:05:16,560
to disbuzz alcohol. M which is you know

3931
03:05:16,560 --> 03:05:17,840
at the end of the day I was in a

3932
03:05:17,840 --> 03:05:19,680
privileged position heading India's

3933
03:05:19,680 --> 03:05:22,319
largest alcohol company. I could say all

3934
03:05:22,319 --> 03:05:25,319
right fine you know but yeah alcohol

3935
03:05:25,319 --> 03:05:28,479
plays a big role in elections in India

3936
03:05:28,479 --> 03:05:30,399
even today.

3937
03:05:30,399 --> 03:05:32,319
How do you make money now?

3938
03:05:32,319 --> 03:05:34,880
How do I make money? Like today, how do

3939
03:05:34,880 --> 03:05:37,040
you make money? I make a I I get a

3940
03:05:37,040 --> 03:05:40,240
modest salary from my company.

3941
03:05:40,240 --> 03:05:43,800
Not the Indian companies.

3942
03:05:43,800 --> 03:05:46,960
No. So you like do you own anything

3943
03:05:46,960 --> 03:05:48,720
here? There are companies here or in

3944
03:05:48,720 --> 03:05:51,680
other countries? Of course. I told you

3945
03:05:51,680 --> 03:05:54,600
I've been a non-resident since

3946
03:05:54,600 --> 03:05:58,720
1988. Okay. Uh even though I sold Bger

3947
03:05:58,720 --> 03:06:01,840
paints in 1996, I've had several other

3948
03:06:01,840 --> 03:06:03,560
businesses outside of

3949
03:06:03,560 --> 03:06:06,960
India for the last 30 years. What was

3950
03:06:06,960 --> 03:06:09,520
your net worth at peak in India? I don't

3951
03:06:09,520 --> 03:06:11,760
know because it fluctuated with the

3952
03:06:11,760 --> 03:06:15,040
share value any number to great amount

3953
03:06:15,040 --> 03:06:17,720
of speculation. Okay.

3954
03:06:17,720 --> 03:06:20,800
Frankly, what difference does it make?

3955
03:06:20,800 --> 03:06:24,319
What's in it worth today? I don't know.

3956
03:06:24,319 --> 03:06:28,319
probably zero according to the banks

3957
03:06:28,319 --> 03:06:30,319
probably. Walk me through your day

3958
03:06:30,319 --> 03:06:32,880
today. What do you do now after all of

3959
03:06:32,880 --> 03:06:35,200
this and done? What time do you wake up?

3960
03:06:35,200 --> 03:06:36,640
How do you keep yourself busy? What do

3961
03:06:36,640 --> 03:06:40,160
you do? Well, I have six dogs. I love

3962
03:06:40,160 --> 03:06:43,120
them. I love dogs. I play with them. I

3963
03:06:43,120 --> 03:06:46,040
like to keep a breast of international

3964
03:06:46,040 --> 03:06:47,560
news.

3965
03:06:47,560 --> 03:06:49,319
Um,

3966
03:06:49,319 --> 03:06:53,600
I love my dogs. I play with them a lot.

3967
03:06:53,600 --> 03:06:56,880
Uh, I have a few classic cars which I

3968
03:06:56,880 --> 03:06:59,640
like to tinker with, but I have an

3969
03:06:59,640 --> 03:07:02,240
office on the property next door with my

3970
03:07:02,240 --> 03:07:04,720
staff and yeah, as I told you, I have

3971
03:07:04,720 --> 03:07:05,960
running

3972
03:07:05,960 --> 03:07:11,520
businesses and so I keep an eye on them,

3973
03:07:11,520 --> 03:07:15,319
but sadly a lot of time is taken on

3974
03:07:15,319 --> 03:07:18,359
unproductive and very expensive legal

3975
03:07:18,359 --> 03:07:20,600
matters.

3976
03:07:20,600 --> 03:07:24,840
Um sadly once again the

3977
03:07:24,840 --> 03:07:28,920
banks in India who

3978
03:07:28,920 --> 03:07:32,040
are stateowned banks public sector

3979
03:07:32,040 --> 03:07:35,279
banks carried their attack on me here

3980
03:07:35,279 --> 03:07:37,319
even before the UK

3981
03:07:37,319 --> 03:07:40,560
courts. So as if Indian legal

3982
03:07:40,560 --> 03:07:43,520
proceedings were not enough they even

3983
03:07:43,520 --> 03:07:46,240
came here. M fine. So, I have to defend

3984
03:07:46,240 --> 03:07:47,840
myself.

3985
03:07:47,840 --> 03:07:49,439
And the businesses that you run here,

3986
03:07:49,439 --> 03:07:50,720
they fund the legal fees and everything

3987
03:07:50,720 --> 03:07:52,800
that you're doing. Yeah. There's, let's

3988
03:07:52,800 --> 03:07:55,600
put it this way, there's enough to go

3989
03:07:55,600 --> 03:07:57,439
around.

3990
03:07:57,439 --> 03:07:59,279
What kind of businesses are here? The

3991
03:07:59,279 --> 03:08:00,720
same brewery or something else. Oh,

3992
03:08:00,720 --> 03:08:03,279
yeah. Yeah. Basically, save my core

3993
03:08:03,279 --> 03:08:05,520
business, alcohol brewery or all that.

3994
03:08:05,520 --> 03:08:07,680
You love it. You love doing the same

3995
03:08:07,680 --> 03:08:09,359
thing. That's what's in my blood. You

3996
03:08:09,359 --> 03:08:11,200
know, I used to joke when I was young. I

3997
03:08:11,200 --> 03:08:15,240
said I was born in a bottle.

3998
03:08:17,600 --> 03:08:20,359
Wow. Do you feel restricted

3999
03:08:20,359 --> 03:08:22,880
now? Because you just use word I was

4000
03:08:22,880 --> 03:08:24,640
born in a bottle. Do you feel that

4001
03:08:24,640 --> 03:08:26,960
you've been caged in a bottle again with

4002
03:08:26,960 --> 03:08:29,359
all these legal matters because you

4003
03:08:29,359 --> 03:08:31,840
don't have a passport.

4004
03:08:31,840 --> 03:08:33,359
You're a free bird flying around all

4005
03:08:33,359 --> 03:08:35,279
over the world. Yeah. So now you're

4006
03:08:35,279 --> 03:08:38,560
stuck here. But that freedom went in

4007
03:08:38,560 --> 03:08:41,680
2016 when the Indian government revoked

4008
03:08:41,680 --> 03:08:44,920
my passport.

4009
03:08:45,279 --> 03:08:48,279
So it wasn't a

4010
03:08:48,279 --> 03:08:51,720
suspension, it was a

4011
03:08:51,720 --> 03:08:54,760
revocation. So I

4012
03:08:54,760 --> 03:08:57,319
knew back

4013
03:08:57,319 --> 03:09:01,520
then the consequence was no trouble,

4014
03:09:01,520 --> 03:09:04,520
right?

4015
03:09:07,240 --> 03:09:10,080
So for a guy who used to be on a plane

4016
03:09:10,080 --> 03:09:12,479
three four times a week flying around

4017
03:09:12,479 --> 03:09:14,040
the

4018
03:09:14,040 --> 03:09:18,040
world to be in one country for nine long

4019
03:09:18,040 --> 03:09:21,960
years certainly a game

4020
03:09:21,960 --> 03:09:25,399
changer. It must be

4021
03:09:25,399 --> 03:09:30,880
but it's not a matter of life and death.

4022
03:09:30,880 --> 03:09:33,720
I mean it isn't that

4023
03:09:33,720 --> 03:09:36,080
profound because there's enough and more

4024
03:09:36,080 --> 03:09:40,040
to do and to enjoy a quality of

4025
03:09:40,040 --> 03:09:44,120
life that okay has shrunk in many

4026
03:09:44,120 --> 03:09:49,279
ways from what used to be but it's still

4027
03:09:49,279 --> 03:09:52,960
okay one must get on and move on. Does

4028
03:09:52,960 --> 03:09:55,600
it not bother you?

4029
03:09:55,600 --> 03:09:58,800
No. Do I well I it doesn't bother me. Do

4030
03:09:58,800 --> 03:10:01,920
I look bothered?

4031
03:10:02,000 --> 03:10:04,640
No, not to me. It's not a question of

4032
03:10:04,640 --> 03:10:07,439
what is the meaning of do I get up in

4033
03:10:07,439 --> 03:10:09,840
the morning and wipe my tears away every

4034
03:10:09,840 --> 03:10:13,200
day? No. Someday some point you're like

4035
03:10:13,200 --> 03:10:14,880
I'm done with this. Like what the hell

4036
03:10:14,880 --> 03:10:18,520
is happening with me? What is my

4037
03:10:18,520 --> 03:10:21,000
solution? What are my

4038
03:10:21,000 --> 03:10:23,439
options? The government of India has

4039
03:10:23,439 --> 03:10:24,840
revoked my

4040
03:10:24,840 --> 03:10:27,680
passport. Right?

4041
03:10:27,680 --> 03:10:30,240
All I can get is a one-way travel pass

4042
03:10:30,240 --> 03:10:34,040
to India. That's it. What about my

4043
03:10:34,040 --> 03:10:36,200
constitutional

4044
03:10:36,200 --> 03:10:39,600
rights that every Indian citizen is

4045
03:10:39,600 --> 03:10:42,880
entitled to a

4046
03:10:43,080 --> 03:10:46,560
passport? And what happens if I try to

4047
03:10:46,560 --> 03:10:49,920
enforce those? It'll drag on for years

4048
03:10:49,920 --> 03:10:53,120
in the court by the time I might be too

4049
03:10:53,120 --> 03:10:56,520
old to travel.

4050
03:10:57,920 --> 03:11:00,720
So don't you feel lonely here? No. Well,

4051
03:11:00,720 --> 03:11:03,520
I have a lot of my friends

4052
03:11:03,520 --> 03:11:08,479
uh here in England. I lot of people come

4053
03:11:08,479 --> 03:11:09,640
and visit

4054
03:11:09,640 --> 03:11:15,120
me. Uh well, another one of life's

4055
03:11:15,120 --> 03:11:17,840
lessons is when times are tough, you

4056
03:11:17,840 --> 03:11:20,880
realize who your actual friends are.

4057
03:11:20,880 --> 03:11:23,080
Then I have realized

4058
03:11:23,080 --> 03:11:25,000
that very

4059
03:11:25,000 --> 03:11:27,040
comprehensively. I mean those who used

4060
03:11:27,040 --> 03:11:32,439
to be my so-called buddies who

4061
03:11:32,439 --> 03:11:35,560
uh in times of

4062
03:11:35,560 --> 03:11:39,600
my heyday for lack of a better word and

4063
03:11:39,600 --> 03:11:42,399
nowhere to be said. So you used to hang

4064
03:11:42,399 --> 03:11:44,960
out with a lot of billionaires,

4065
03:11:44,960 --> 03:11:47,359
Bollywood celebrities, politicians, lot

4066
03:11:47,359 --> 03:11:48,640
of people and your friends from the

4067
03:11:48,640 --> 03:11:51,680
corporate world. They all stopped taking

4068
03:11:51,680 --> 03:11:54,479
up your calls. No, no, no, no. The

4069
03:11:54,479 --> 03:11:56,760
politicians certainly

4070
03:11:56,760 --> 03:12:00,399
stopped. And I think as one one of the

4071
03:12:00,399 --> 03:12:02,800
many politicians explained to me quite

4072
03:12:02,800 --> 03:12:05,120
truthfully, which I respect, he said if

4073
03:12:05,120 --> 03:12:07,040
we are seen to be associated with Jews,

4074
03:12:07,040 --> 03:12:09,600
this government will come after us, you

4075
03:12:09,600 --> 03:12:11,760
know, because I think there in the

4076
03:12:11,760 --> 03:12:14,080
political world, I think it's pretty

4077
03:12:14,080 --> 03:12:16,319
well known and more importantly pretty

4078
03:12:16,319 --> 03:12:17,920
obvious that this government is after

4079
03:12:17,920 --> 03:12:19,880
me. M

4080
03:12:19,880 --> 03:12:23,720
um so they want to protect

4081
03:12:23,720 --> 03:12:26,760
themselves as far as

4082
03:12:26,760 --> 03:12:30,399
uh corporate titans are concerned I mean

4083
03:12:30,399 --> 03:12:34,080
Kiran Mazumar bless her soul she's like

4084
03:12:34,080 --> 03:12:36,800
my sister makes it a point to be in

4085
03:12:36,800 --> 03:12:37,800
constant

4086
03:12:37,800 --> 03:12:41,600
touch comes to England we always have a

4087
03:12:41,600 --> 03:12:44,080
meal together and like that there are

4088
03:12:44,080 --> 03:12:45,560
few other good

4089
03:12:45,560 --> 03:12:48,680
friends who keep in touch but

4090
03:12:48,680 --> 03:12:50,359
Otherwise

4091
03:12:50,359 --> 03:12:53,680
no certainly not as frequently as I

4092
03:12:53,680 --> 03:12:55,120
would have been in touch with them or

4093
03:12:55,120 --> 03:12:58,399
seen them when I was in India and all

4094
03:12:58,399 --> 03:13:00,560
these troubles hadn't started. Talk

4095
03:13:00,560 --> 03:13:04,000
about Kiran Mazumar Sha she publicly

4096
03:13:04,000 --> 03:13:06,240
talks about you and how close you were

4097
03:13:06,240 --> 03:13:08,720
like since childhood you were friends

4098
03:13:08,720 --> 03:13:11,200
and she talks about your generosity your

4099
03:13:11,200 --> 03:13:15,279
optimism. She's been very vocal that you

4100
03:13:15,279 --> 03:13:19,600
gave it all to save and fight it all.

4101
03:13:19,600 --> 03:13:23,319
You she has gone out in public and said

4102
03:13:23,319 --> 03:13:25,840
that just it was bad times and bad

4103
03:13:25,840 --> 03:13:28,239
things which happened to you but you

4104
03:13:28,239 --> 03:13:30,960
were right and you gave it all away. So

4105
03:13:30,960 --> 03:13:33,680
she talks about it and someone of that

4106
03:13:33,680 --> 03:13:37,840
stature living in a very public market

4107
03:13:37,840 --> 03:13:40,319
in country like India usually people

4108
03:13:40,319 --> 03:13:42,000
stay away from these conversations and

4109
03:13:42,000 --> 03:13:44,160
people would want to she talks but she

4110
03:13:44,160 --> 03:13:46,080
doesn't she talks about it everyone

4111
03:13:46,080 --> 03:13:48,720
every time people ask about you she's

4112
03:13:48,720 --> 03:13:50,399
been okay about it in fact there was a

4113
03:13:50,399 --> 03:13:53,840
statement that she said lot of people

4114
03:13:53,840 --> 03:13:56,560
are optimistic which I was probably

4115
03:13:56,560 --> 03:14:00,720
rather more optimistic than most and

4116
03:14:00,720 --> 03:14:02,640
version of just optimism. Let me tell

4117
03:14:02,640 --> 03:14:04,800
you, Kiran and me grew up together. I

4118
03:14:04,800 --> 03:14:06,160
talked about the brewery house in

4119
03:14:06,160 --> 03:14:08,239
Bangalore. At that time there was a

4120
03:14:08,239 --> 03:14:10,560
little colony. So there was a brewery

4121
03:14:10,560 --> 03:14:12,720
house in which I lived and then four

4122
03:14:12,720 --> 03:14:15,359
other bungalows. The one next to the

4123
03:14:15,359 --> 03:14:17,439
brewery house was actually occupied by

4124
03:14:17,439 --> 03:14:20,399
Kiran Mazuman and her father. Her father

4125
03:14:20,399 --> 03:14:22,640
was the chief brewer and the technical

4126
03:14:22,640 --> 03:14:26,120
director of UB. Okay. Okay.

4127
03:14:26,120 --> 03:14:29,520
And so Kiran and her two brothers and

4128
03:14:29,520 --> 03:14:34,239
mom grew up in my house in my in my

4129
03:14:34,239 --> 03:14:36,800
colony with one wall separating us. So

4130
03:14:36,800 --> 03:14:41,399
we were very very close uh and

4131
03:14:41,399 --> 03:14:45,720
and Kiran has been very very

4132
03:14:45,720 --> 03:14:48,800
different. She started off being a

4133
03:14:48,800 --> 03:14:51,439
qualified brew master.

4134
03:14:51,439 --> 03:14:53,560
How many Indian

4135
03:14:53,560 --> 03:14:57,560
women can you think of who would go and

4136
03:14:57,560 --> 03:15:00,359
qualify as a brew

4137
03:15:00,359 --> 03:15:03,439
master? But Kiran was determined to do

4138
03:15:03,439 --> 03:15:07,399
it and she did it in Australia.

4139
03:15:09,000 --> 03:15:11,640
So Kiran as an

4140
03:15:11,640 --> 03:15:14,000
entrepreneur not only has been brilliant

4141
03:15:14,000 --> 03:15:17,160
but has a super brilliant track

4142
03:15:17,160 --> 03:15:20,640
record but she's a tough cookie and she

4143
03:15:20,640 --> 03:15:23,439
speaks her mind which is something that

4144
03:15:23,439 --> 03:15:24,840
people should

4145
03:15:24,840 --> 03:15:28,560
respect and being a woman at that. So

4146
03:15:28,560 --> 03:15:31,359
I'm so grateful for her public support

4147
03:15:31,359 --> 03:15:34,319
of me. She knows what I went through

4148
03:15:34,319 --> 03:15:36,640
with Kingfisher Airlines. I used to

4149
03:15:36,640 --> 03:15:39,279
share it with her all the time. And she

4150
03:15:39,279 --> 03:15:42,560
knew that I gave it my all. I forget

4151
03:15:42,560 --> 03:15:46,479
about just putting in 3,000 crores. I

4152
03:15:46,479 --> 03:15:47,239
mean,

4153
03:15:47,239 --> 03:15:50,319
every bit of my blood, sweat, and tears

4154
03:15:50,319 --> 03:15:52,560
went into trying to make King Fisher

4155
03:15:52,560 --> 03:15:54,040
Airlines

4156
03:15:54,040 --> 03:15:57,760
work. Now that she isn't here, you're

4157
03:15:57,760 --> 03:15:58,840
not

4158
03:15:58,840 --> 03:16:04,000
there. You're alone. friends, parties,

4159
03:16:04,000 --> 03:16:06,640
uh businesses, that busy, restless life,

4160
03:16:06,640 --> 03:16:07,880
nothing is

4161
03:16:07,880 --> 03:16:11,040
there. In 9 years, what was the

4162
03:16:11,040 --> 03:16:14,840
loneliest day of your life?

4163
03:16:14,840 --> 03:16:18,800
I I always have had something to do. I

4164
03:16:18,800 --> 03:16:20,120
haven't been

4165
03:16:20,120 --> 03:16:26,680
sitting alone. Uh I told you I my

4166
03:16:26,680 --> 03:16:29,760
interests keep me occupied. My pace of

4167
03:16:29,760 --> 03:16:33,560
life is slowed down

4168
03:16:33,560 --> 03:16:37,040
dramatically. My pace of life now is

4169
03:16:37,040 --> 03:16:38,760
probably one of

4170
03:16:38,760 --> 03:16:41,000
semi-retirement to be

4171
03:16:41,000 --> 03:16:44,439
honest. But that's what

4172
03:16:44,439 --> 03:16:47,680
happens when you reach retirement age,

4173
03:16:47,680 --> 03:16:48,920
isn't

4174
03:16:48,920 --> 03:16:53,319
it? So the frenzy of the

4175
03:16:53,319 --> 03:16:56,040
past doesn't last

4176
03:16:56,040 --> 03:16:59,840
forever. And I'm in that phase.

4177
03:16:59,840 --> 03:17:01,920
But I have enough and more interest to

4178
03:17:01,920 --> 03:17:05,359
keep me occupied.

4179
03:17:05,359 --> 03:17:07,359
What do people misunderstand about you?

4180
03:17:07,359 --> 03:17:09,680
I don't know what people understand to

4181
03:17:09,680 --> 03:17:12,120
begin with. Forget about

4182
03:17:12,120 --> 03:17:15,160
misunderstanding. I

4183
03:17:15,160 --> 03:17:18,399
mean, people in general, particularly

4184
03:17:18,399 --> 03:17:22,000
the media, they hate my guts.

4185
03:17:22,000 --> 03:17:24,640
They don't like the fact that I rarely

4186
03:17:24,640 --> 03:17:25,720
get

4187
03:17:25,720 --> 03:17:28,880
flustered and they try to break me down

4188
03:17:28,880 --> 03:17:32,000
deliberately brick by brick. They try

4189
03:17:32,000 --> 03:17:34,640
very very hard but you know maybe it's

4190
03:17:34,640 --> 03:17:37,520
my upbringing in life. Maybe because I

4191
03:17:37,520 --> 03:17:39,560
started very

4192
03:17:39,560 --> 03:17:41,479
young. I'm

4193
03:17:41,479 --> 03:17:45,680
tough and tough so I don't get brow

4194
03:17:45,680 --> 03:17:48,960
beats. I don't get pushed over. I stand

4195
03:17:48,960 --> 03:17:51,840
my ground.

4196
03:17:51,840 --> 03:17:53,239
And the media hate

4197
03:17:53,239 --> 03:17:58,080
it. They absolutely hate it. So I've

4198
03:17:58,080 --> 03:18:01,920
heard all this. Malia is arrogant. Malia

4199
03:18:01,920 --> 03:18:05,520
is a show off X Y and Z. And the

4200
03:18:05,520 --> 03:18:08,399
narrative keeps repeating time and time

4201
03:18:08,399 --> 03:18:09,560
and time

4202
03:18:09,560 --> 03:18:11,239
again

4203
03:18:11,239 --> 03:18:13,840
because I have never taken out my

4204
03:18:13,840 --> 03:18:15,760
handkerchief and started weeping in

4205
03:18:15,760 --> 03:18:18,640
front of them.

4206
03:18:18,640 --> 03:18:21,439
They would love that. If I did that in

4207
03:18:21,439 --> 03:18:23,279
front of the legacy media, probably the

4208
03:18:23,279 --> 03:18:26,080
whole narrative about me would change.

4209
03:18:26,080 --> 03:18:30,080
But that's not me. Is this also has this

4210
03:18:30,080 --> 03:18:32,640
become your defense mechanism now? There

4211
03:18:32,640 --> 03:18:34,720
was never any defense mechanism. Like

4212
03:18:34,720 --> 03:18:36,880
now it has become your image that hey I

4213
03:18:36,880 --> 03:18:39,359
don't get I'm not going to break in

4214
03:18:39,359 --> 03:18:40,720
front of you guys. So I'm going to stick

4215
03:18:40,720 --> 03:18:43,120
through it and that's why I won't show

4216
03:18:43,120 --> 03:18:44,479
my real side. I won't show my real

4217
03:18:44,479 --> 03:18:46,319
emotions. I won't show what I'm feeling.

4218
03:18:46,319 --> 03:18:48,720
But what I'm feeling is real. There is

4219
03:18:48,720 --> 03:18:52,200
no other side. There is no other

4220
03:18:52,200 --> 03:18:54,840
side. Please

4221
03:18:54,840 --> 03:18:57,239
understand for 50

4222
03:18:57,239 --> 03:19:01,279
years. I've been in charge. I've been

4223
03:19:01,279 --> 03:19:02,680
through a

4224
03:19:02,680 --> 03:19:06,080
lot. I've been there, done that. He's

4225
03:19:06,080 --> 03:19:08,040
toughened me

4226
03:19:08,040 --> 03:19:11,239
up. I faced the crisis of Kingfisher

4227
03:19:11,239 --> 03:19:14,560
Airlines. I felt it more than anybody

4228
03:19:14,560 --> 03:19:17,760
else. I gave it my all, but I kept

4229
03:19:17,760 --> 03:19:21,239
myself together because I was a

4230
03:19:21,239 --> 03:19:24,560
leader. If I had crumbled and collapsed,

4231
03:19:24,560 --> 03:19:26,160
the airline would have crumbled and

4232
03:19:26,160 --> 03:19:28,560
collapsed a lot earlier than it did.

4233
03:19:28,560 --> 03:19:30,399
What are you feeling right now as you

4234
03:19:30,399 --> 03:19:33,040
talk about you gave it all and you still

4235
03:19:33,040 --> 03:19:35,680
couldn't save King Fisher? Well, I'm I'm

4236
03:19:35,680 --> 03:19:37,680
sad about it because you know it's not

4237
03:19:37,680 --> 03:19:39,319
just about King

4238
03:19:39,319 --> 03:19:41,760
Fisher. I have never been used to

4239
03:19:41,760 --> 03:19:44,399
business failure.

4240
03:19:44,399 --> 03:19:48,000
I took risks. I made bold decisions and

4241
03:19:48,000 --> 03:19:52,319
I built my core business in alcohol into

4242
03:19:52,319 --> 03:19:55,960
something I could be greatly proud

4243
03:19:55,960 --> 03:19:59,359
of. I failed with Kingfisher and that

4244
03:19:59,359 --> 03:20:02,720
hurts me more than anything else.

4245
03:20:02,720 --> 03:20:06,000
Kingfisher was a wonderful product,

4246
03:20:06,000 --> 03:20:08,840
probably the most awarded airline

4247
03:20:08,840 --> 03:20:12,399
ever, providing connectivity to places

4248
03:20:12,399 --> 03:20:14,960
in India that were never connected by

4249
03:20:14,960 --> 03:20:16,600
air

4250
03:20:16,600 --> 03:20:19,000
before and in an

4251
03:20:19,000 --> 03:20:20,520
environment

4252
03:20:20,520 --> 03:20:23,000
promising

4253
03:20:23,000 --> 03:20:26,319
growth. Today, India is the biggest

4254
03:20:26,319 --> 03:20:29,279
single growth market for aviation in the

4255
03:20:29,279 --> 03:20:31,040
world.

4256
03:20:31,040 --> 03:20:32,960
Can you imagine if King Fcher was still

4257
03:20:32,960 --> 03:20:36,160
flying? It was just circumstances at

4258
03:20:36,160 --> 03:20:38,880
that particular time, government

4259
03:20:38,880 --> 03:20:41,319
policies that didn't

4260
03:20:41,319 --> 03:20:43,720
help and mounting

4261
03:20:43,720 --> 03:20:46,720
losses. But I gave it my all. I I told

4262
03:20:46,720 --> 03:20:49,279
you quite apart from putting in 3,000

4263
03:20:49,279 --> 03:20:53,399
crores cash into Kingfisher

4264
03:20:53,399 --> 03:20:57,279
Airlines and the final straw was the

4265
03:20:57,279 --> 03:21:00,439
refusal to let Etihad invest in King

4266
03:21:00,439 --> 03:21:03,640
Fisha and that was it. I had run out of

4267
03:21:03,640 --> 03:21:06,600
options. Can you imagine how I

4268
03:21:06,600 --> 03:21:09,359
felt? I felt miserable. What's your

4269
03:21:09,359 --> 03:21:12,720
biggest fear now? My fear? Are you

4270
03:21:12,720 --> 03:21:16,120
afraid of anything?

4271
03:21:18,439 --> 03:21:21,800
Well, what can I be afraid

4272
03:21:21,800 --> 03:21:24,720
of? What can I be afraid of? What do I

4273
03:21:24,720 --> 03:21:26,760
do that would scare

4274
03:21:26,760 --> 03:21:30,960
me? Living a semi-retired life, what can

4275
03:21:30,960 --> 03:21:33,680
happen that's going to

4276
03:21:33,680 --> 03:21:37,120
uh scare me? Extradition.

4277
03:21:37,120 --> 03:21:38,840
Oh, yeah.

4278
03:21:38,840 --> 03:21:41,439
Look, if you're talking about the legal

4279
03:21:41,439 --> 03:21:44,479
issues, there are multiple legal issues.

4280
03:21:44,479 --> 03:21:46,279
All right,

4281
03:21:46,279 --> 03:21:48,279
which I will

4282
03:21:48,279 --> 03:21:51,760
defend before the courts of law both in

4283
03:21:51,760 --> 03:21:54,600
this country as well as in

4284
03:21:54,600 --> 03:21:56,760
India.

4285
03:21:56,760 --> 03:22:00,800
And any legal case can go either way.

4286
03:22:00,800 --> 03:22:04,760
You can't sit and predict the

4287
03:22:04,760 --> 03:22:07,439
outcome. Neither can you celebrate a

4288
03:22:07,439 --> 03:22:09,680
potential outcome and neither can you

4289
03:22:09,680 --> 03:22:12,640
cry about a potential outcome. That's

4290
03:22:12,640 --> 03:22:15,359
what legal cases are all about. But are

4291
03:22:15,359 --> 03:22:17,680
you prepared for the worst? Of course, I

4292
03:22:17,680 --> 03:22:22,399
have to face the worst. I

4293
03:22:22,680 --> 03:22:26,640
I no qualms or no doubts in my mind that

4294
03:22:26,640 --> 03:22:30,160
if the worst is what is destined for me,

4295
03:22:30,160 --> 03:22:31,920
that's what's destined for me and you

4296
03:22:31,920 --> 03:22:34,000
face it head on. What do you think is

4297
03:22:34,000 --> 03:22:36,680
worst? What is what can happen the

4298
03:22:36,680 --> 03:22:40,080
worst? Oh, what I think is very clear,

4299
03:22:40,080 --> 03:22:42,080
what the Indian government wants, what

4300
03:22:42,080 --> 03:22:45,920
many of the Indian media anchors want,

4301
03:22:45,920 --> 03:22:46,920
jail

4302
03:22:46,920 --> 03:22:49,880
clothes, jail

4303
03:22:49,880 --> 03:22:54,239
food in Thihar or Arur Road or God knows

4304
03:22:54,239 --> 03:22:56,479
which jail in India. That's it. And

4305
03:22:56,479 --> 03:22:59,319
spend the rest of my life behind

4306
03:22:59,319 --> 03:23:02,000
bars. That's it. Have you ever imagined

4307
03:23:02,000 --> 03:23:04,560
yourself actually going to jail? Well,

4308
03:23:04,560 --> 03:23:06,880
if that's what is inevitable, what

4309
03:23:06,880 --> 03:23:10,399
option do I have? Is it inevitable?

4310
03:23:10,399 --> 03:23:11,239
Might

4311
03:23:11,239 --> 03:23:13,479
be. I'm not an

4312
03:23:13,479 --> 03:23:16,880
astrologer. I'll fight my way in court.

4313
03:23:16,880 --> 03:23:19,600
Doesn't it scare you that I lived a

4314
03:23:19,600 --> 03:23:21,680
king-sized life and now I might end up

4315
03:23:21,680 --> 03:23:26,000
in jail? Uh, and those that is how I'm

4316
03:23:26,000 --> 03:23:28,319
going to end my life like probably.

4317
03:23:28,319 --> 03:23:32,239
Correct. So, I said earlier today,

4318
03:23:32,239 --> 03:23:35,200
right? hero to zero

4319
03:23:35,200 --> 03:23:38,080
and you're okay with it. What option do

4320
03:23:38,080 --> 03:23:41,479
I have? Do you ever wake up and think

4321
03:23:41,479 --> 03:23:44,640
like [Â __Â ] why me? What is this

4322
03:23:44,640 --> 03:23:46,479
happening? Because in your head you're

4323
03:23:46,479 --> 03:23:49,040
clear and you say that you've not done

4324
03:23:49,040 --> 03:23:52,239
anything wrong. So do you ever feel like

4325
03:23:52,239 --> 03:23:56,840
why the hell me? Maybe that's my

4326
03:23:56,840 --> 03:24:02,000
destiny. Maybe my stars are misalignant.

4327
03:24:02,000 --> 03:24:05,120
Do you believe in it?

4328
03:24:06,279 --> 03:24:08,840
No. I don't believe in

4329
03:24:08,840 --> 03:24:14,040
astrology. But do you believe in God? In

4330
03:24:14,040 --> 03:24:17,359
God very much so. I'm deeply religious.

4331
03:24:17,359 --> 03:24:20,319
I have gone to most of the temples in

4332
03:24:20,319 --> 03:24:22,880
India particularly South India. I've

4333
03:24:22,880 --> 03:24:24,760
made my modest

4334
03:24:24,760 --> 03:24:29,200
offerings to various temples. I I don't

4335
03:24:29,200 --> 03:24:32,800
know whether you know but the Sabriala

4336
03:24:32,800 --> 03:24:34,840
temple in Kerala the

4337
03:24:34,840 --> 03:24:38,840
entire gold roof was donated by

4338
03:24:38,840 --> 03:24:41,160
me. Tirupati

4339
03:24:41,160 --> 03:24:44,560
Tirumala temple uh the entire gold

4340
03:24:44,560 --> 03:24:46,720
plating of the front of the sanctum was

4341
03:24:46,720 --> 03:24:50,960
donated by me. I've donated dwaja tambas

4342
03:24:50,960 --> 03:24:54,479
in the subramanya temple and moambika

4343
03:24:54,479 --> 03:24:56,680
temple.

4344
03:24:56,680 --> 03:25:00,880
I Yeah. So I I definitely believe in

4345
03:25:00,880 --> 03:25:04,160
God. Do you not then question it? No, I

4346
03:25:04,160 --> 03:25:06,720
don't question it. I just I just I

4347
03:25:06,720 --> 03:25:09,120
believe like I believe in God so much. I

4348
03:25:09,120 --> 03:25:14,160
do so much for my religious belief and

4349
03:25:14,160 --> 03:25:16,000
still I'm going through all of this.

4350
03:25:16,000 --> 03:25:20,040
Yeah. Well, ultimately God will protect

4351
03:25:20,040 --> 03:25:24,920
me. That if I have to have a rough

4352
03:25:24,920 --> 03:25:28,399
ride in the process, maybe that was also

4353
03:25:28,399 --> 03:25:32,200
what God wants. Do you think winning the

4354
03:25:32,200 --> 03:25:36,960
case is important for you now? Or you're

4355
03:25:36,960 --> 03:25:39,120
like, even if it gets stretched, I've

4356
03:25:39,120 --> 03:25:41,600
come terms to my life. I'm aging. It's

4357
03:25:41,600 --> 03:25:42,800
okay.

4358
03:25:42,800 --> 03:25:45,600
Unfortunately, the word stretch doesn't

4359
03:25:45,600 --> 03:25:48,040
work in English

4360
03:25:48,040 --> 03:25:50,319
courts. Okay. There's nothing known as

4361
03:25:50,319 --> 03:25:53,279
stretching a case in this country. In

4362
03:25:53,279 --> 03:25:56,080
India, yes, sadly, that's why legal

4363
03:25:56,080 --> 03:25:58,560
matters take so much time to resolve.

4364
03:25:58,560 --> 03:26:01,200
Here, dates fix, trial, it's fixed,

4365
03:26:01,200 --> 03:26:03,239
decision rendered, story

4366
03:26:03,239 --> 03:26:07,120
over. So, you can't willfully kind of

4367
03:26:07,120 --> 03:26:09,760
string things along. But is it important

4368
03:26:09,760 --> 03:26:11,760
for you to win?

4369
03:26:11,760 --> 03:26:16,120
Yes, because I believe I should win on

4370
03:26:16,120 --> 03:26:18,319
merit. What have I done? I've done

4371
03:26:18,319 --> 03:26:19,560
nothing

4372
03:26:19,560 --> 03:26:23,279
wrong. I haven't I'm not a criminal. If

4373
03:26:23,279 --> 03:26:26,239
you could go back to your younger self,

4374
03:26:26,239 --> 03:26:28,800
what would you tell your younger self?

4375
03:26:28,800 --> 03:26:31,920
Would you tell him to do anything

4376
03:26:31,920 --> 03:26:34,319
differently? I think the values I've

4377
03:26:34,319 --> 03:26:35,800
instilled in

4378
03:26:35,800 --> 03:26:39,920
my my son in particular and my all my

4379
03:26:39,920 --> 03:26:42,439
three children is by example my hard

4380
03:26:42,439 --> 03:26:45,439
work. They have of course they were very

4381
03:26:45,439 --> 03:26:47,880
young but they've seen how hard I

4382
03:26:47,880 --> 03:26:51,600
worked and basically the dedication and

4383
03:26:51,600 --> 03:26:55,560
commitment to your objectives and your

4384
03:26:55,560 --> 03:26:57,920
responsibilities. That's it. But would

4385
03:26:57,920 --> 03:26:59,600
you go to your younger self and tell

4386
03:26:59,600 --> 03:27:01,359
something different? What could what

4387
03:27:01,359 --> 03:27:04,800
what choices would I have? If you gave

4388
03:27:04,800 --> 03:27:07,279
me a choice on what I would choose, I

4389
03:27:07,279 --> 03:27:09,840
might choose. But if I was probably

4390
03:27:09,840 --> 03:27:11,760
never start Kingfisher Airlines because

4391
03:27:11,760 --> 03:27:14,000
that all cost you the trouble. Yeah,

4392
03:27:14,000 --> 03:27:17,439
good possibility. Good possibility that

4393
03:27:17,439 --> 03:27:20,960
maybe I should have just said I'm going

4394
03:27:20,960 --> 03:27:23,359
to stick to my core business of alcohol

4395
03:27:23,359 --> 03:27:25,760
and just not do anything else. Do you

4396
03:27:25,760 --> 03:27:27,600
think any part of it you would have

4397
03:27:27,600 --> 03:27:28,760
dealt

4398
03:27:28,760 --> 03:27:31,560
with little in a different

4399
03:27:31,560 --> 03:27:35,359
way anything about you about the choices

4400
03:27:35,359 --> 03:27:37,439
you've made? Yeah, maybe I made one

4401
03:27:37,439 --> 03:27:40,319
wrong choice in listening to the finance

4402
03:27:40,319 --> 03:27:42,880
minister Mr. Prana Mukhaji when I went

4403
03:27:42,880 --> 03:27:45,279
to him I realized the writing was on the

4404
03:27:45,279 --> 03:27:48,399
wall. They were very tough times and I

4405
03:27:48,399 --> 03:27:50,520
told him I have to downsize this

4406
03:27:50,520 --> 03:27:53,439
airline and he said no no no you cannot

4407
03:27:53,439 --> 03:27:55,359
and the banks will support you and so on

4408
03:27:55,359 --> 03:27:59,279
and so forth and yeah I I listened to

4409
03:27:59,279 --> 03:28:01,040
him maybe I shouldn't have I should have

4410
03:28:01,040 --> 03:28:04,080
gone ahead and downsized it and had I

4411
03:28:04,080 --> 03:28:06,479
downsized it the financial burden would

4412
03:28:06,479 --> 03:28:10,160
have been far less and probably king

4413
03:28:10,160 --> 03:28:12,399
Fischer would have been flying till

4414
03:28:12,399 --> 03:28:15,279
today what's one thing about extreme

4415
03:28:15,279 --> 03:28:16,120
wealth

4416
03:28:16,120 --> 03:28:18,640
that people common people don't

4417
03:28:18,640 --> 03:28:20,479
understand.

4418
03:28:20,479 --> 03:28:23,200
I don't know because I've never had

4419
03:28:23,200 --> 03:28:27,279
extreme wealth uh ever.

4420
03:28:27,279 --> 03:28:29,279
The kind of wealth you had was extreme

4421
03:28:29,279 --> 03:28:31,760
for a large share of people around the

4422
03:28:31,760 --> 03:28:33,600
world, not just our country. Once again,

4423
03:28:33,600 --> 03:28:35,080
a major

4424
03:28:35,080 --> 03:28:37,279
misconception. Just because I had the

4425
03:28:37,279 --> 03:28:39,720
Kingfisher calendar with pretty

4426
03:28:39,720 --> 03:28:44,000
models. Just because I I sponsored the

4427
03:28:44,000 --> 03:28:46,600
Indian Derby in horse

4428
03:28:46,600 --> 03:28:50,680
racing. Just because I sponsored

4429
03:28:50,680 --> 03:28:55,279
fashion. All of which were to my mind

4430
03:28:55,279 --> 03:28:58,080
marketing tools with the singular

4431
03:28:58,080 --> 03:29:02,399
objective of promoting my brands. And I

4432
03:29:02,399 --> 03:29:06,720
got the tag of king of good times which

4433
03:29:06,720 --> 03:29:08,920
gave the impression that I was super

4434
03:29:08,920 --> 03:29:11,960
rich. I didn't spend a penny from my

4435
03:29:11,960 --> 03:29:15,200
pocket. None. But you were super rich.

4436
03:29:15,200 --> 03:29:17,920
You still are super rich. I'm not. All

4437
03:29:17,920 --> 03:29:19,080
my

4438
03:29:19,080 --> 03:29:21,560
assets in India have been

4439
03:29:21,560 --> 03:29:24,720
taken. Right. So yes, there were

4440
03:29:24,720 --> 03:29:26,279
thousands of

4441
03:29:26,279 --> 03:29:31,479
crone. Right? So what do I have left?

4442
03:29:31,520 --> 03:29:34,840
That's India. Here you're sitting in my

4443
03:29:34,840 --> 03:29:38,800
house. I've explained my

4444
03:29:39,239 --> 03:29:41,160
lifestyle. It's

4445
03:29:41,160 --> 03:29:45,840
normal. What's super rich about

4446
03:29:48,040 --> 03:29:51,520
it? Come on. This is super. What's super

4447
03:29:51,520 --> 03:29:54,239
rich about it? This is super rich. Let's

4448
03:29:54,239 --> 03:29:58,560
just agree to disagree here because come

4449
03:29:58,560 --> 03:30:01,200
on. Like what are we even talking about?

4450
03:30:01,200 --> 03:30:05,760
This is not a life of somebody a normal

4451
03:30:05,760 --> 03:30:08,000
taxpayer or a normal person going to a

4452
03:30:08,000 --> 03:30:11,680
job or 99% of the people in the world.

4453
03:30:11,680 --> 03:30:13,840
Were you ever in control of your public

4454
03:30:13,840 --> 03:30:18,560
image? Why I never even tried?

4455
03:30:18,560 --> 03:30:20,000
Because what you're telling the version

4456
03:30:20,000 --> 03:30:24,160
that I get to see in last two days and

4457
03:30:24,160 --> 03:30:26,080
what probably millions of people would

4458
03:30:26,080 --> 03:30:28,960
get to see now

4459
03:30:28,960 --> 03:30:31,520
is a version that is completely

4460
03:30:31,520 --> 03:30:34,560
different that is out there. That's why

4461
03:30:34,560 --> 03:30:36,560
I'm doing the podcast with you. You

4462
03:30:36,560 --> 03:30:38,960
built a personal brand which crashed

4463
03:30:38,960 --> 03:30:41,359
down way worse than King Fisher

4464
03:30:41,359 --> 03:30:44,359
Airlines.

4465
03:30:44,479 --> 03:30:46,960
Did you ever make it or it was always

4466
03:30:46,960 --> 03:30:49,040
just the media who did it? It was always

4467
03:30:49,040 --> 03:30:50,800
the media who did it. So you were never

4468
03:30:50,800 --> 03:30:52,800
control of your personal brand ever at

4469
03:30:52,800 --> 03:30:54,439
any point? Not

4470
03:30:54,439 --> 03:30:57,520
once. Never even paid attention to it.

4471
03:30:57,520 --> 03:30:59,680
And you never bothered.

4472
03:30:59,680 --> 03:31:01,680
No. Why should I bother? And why bother

4473
03:31:01,680 --> 03:31:03,200
now?

4474
03:31:03,200 --> 03:31:06,720
Absolutely correct.

4475
03:31:06,720 --> 03:31:09,640
But what's going on? Like

4476
03:31:09,640 --> 03:31:14,319
why why do you care now? Because I'm not

4477
03:31:14,319 --> 03:31:17,760
talking about brand Vijay Mallaya. I'm

4478
03:31:17,760 --> 03:31:21,439
talking about how I have been

4479
03:31:21,960 --> 03:31:25,680
wronged. I'd like to show you something.

4480
03:31:25,680 --> 03:31:28,439
All right. Here

4481
03:31:28,439 --> 03:31:32,640
is here is the recovery certificate of

4482
03:31:32,640 --> 03:31:36,239
the debt recovery tribunal. Right? It

4483
03:31:36,239 --> 03:31:37,720
says recovery

4484
03:31:37,720 --> 03:31:40,600
certificate

4485
03:31:40,600 --> 03:31:45,080
6,23 crores 35 lakhs

4486
03:31:45,080 --> 03:31:50,239
3,879 and Pisa 42 only.

4487
03:31:50,239 --> 03:31:51,239
That's the

4488
03:31:51,239 --> 03:31:56,160
6,23 crores plus interest at 11.5% with

4489
03:31:56,160 --> 03:31:57,640
yearly

4490
03:31:57,640 --> 03:32:01,319
rests. All right. So that

4491
03:32:01,319 --> 03:32:03,640
is that is

4492
03:32:03,640 --> 03:32:08,880
evidence of the debt. Right? Okay. You

4493
03:32:08,880 --> 03:32:11,319
asked me

4494
03:32:11,319 --> 03:32:16,239
earlier where did this 9,000 cr figure

4495
03:32:16,239 --> 03:32:17,920
come from?

4496
03:32:17,920 --> 03:32:21,800
This is the official debt recovery

4497
03:32:21,800 --> 03:32:25,800
tribunal Karnataka Bangalore's

4498
03:32:25,800 --> 03:32:28,479
document that's and they have said that

4499
03:32:28,479 --> 03:32:32,319
you owe 6,2003 cr rupees me along with

4500
03:32:32,319 --> 03:32:35,359
four others four others yeah correct

4501
03:32:35,359 --> 03:32:38,080
okay kingfisher airlines United Beries

4502
03:32:38,080 --> 03:32:41,120
Vijay Malia Kingfisher fine west correct

4503
03:32:41,120 --> 03:32:45,319
okay so the assets of all those

4504
03:32:45,319 --> 03:32:47,000
combined

4505
03:32:47,000 --> 03:32:49,920
right would need to satisfy the judgment

4506
03:32:49,920 --> 03:32:54,160
debt of 6,0002 crores. Yeah. Before I go

4507
03:32:54,160 --> 03:32:58,720
very further, I'm the one under attack.

4508
03:32:58,720 --> 03:33:02,960
Not all four. Anyway, you ask me about

4509
03:33:02,960 --> 03:33:06,319
where this 9,000 figure came from. Yeah,

4510
03:33:06,319 --> 03:33:08,640
because it's written 6,2003.

4511
03:33:08,640 --> 03:33:10,479
No problem. Plus interest, whatever the

4512
03:33:10,479 --> 03:33:14,399
case may be. That is dated 2017. If you

4513
03:33:14,399 --> 03:33:18,200
see the date of the document.

4514
03:33:23,000 --> 03:33:27,120
Yeah, I can't. Where is this? Maybe you

4515
03:33:27,120 --> 03:33:30,319
should go to the end. Okay. Last

4516
03:33:30,319 --> 03:33:33,720
signing. Yeah. Date of

4517
03:33:33,720 --> 03:33:38,880
deliveries 26 July 17. Correct. Okay.

4518
03:33:38,880 --> 03:33:40,760
And

4519
03:33:40,760 --> 03:33:43,560
then I'll show you

4520
03:33:43,560 --> 03:33:46,640
another report about an interview with

4521
03:33:46,640 --> 03:33:47,800
the prime

4522
03:33:47,800 --> 03:33:50,720
minister. Okay.

4523
03:33:50,720 --> 03:33:52,040
March

4524
03:33:52,040 --> 03:33:54,840
29,

4525
03:33:54,840 --> 03:33:56,600
2019 in

4526
03:33:56,600 --> 03:33:59,319
which the prime

4527
03:33:59,319 --> 03:34:01,479
minister has

4528
03:34:01,479 --> 03:34:05,640
said he owed 9,000

4529
03:34:05,640 --> 03:34:12,080
cr but government recovered 14,000 cr

4530
03:34:12,080 --> 03:34:17,040
says PM Modi on India's action against

4531
03:34:17,040 --> 03:34:19,920
Vijay Malia.

4532
03:34:29,160 --> 03:34:32,160
Yeah.

4533
03:34:32,279 --> 03:34:36,399
But so why would a PM say 9,000 cr where

4534
03:34:36,399 --> 03:34:38,640
this

4535
03:34:39,239 --> 03:34:42,920
number? I am as perplexed as you

4536
03:34:42,920 --> 03:34:46,800
are because the banks have not ever

4537
03:34:46,800 --> 03:34:49,680
submitted a statement of account to me

4538
03:34:49,680 --> 03:34:52,439
which in itself is very

4539
03:34:52,439 --> 03:34:56,160
strange but the prime minister has said

4540
03:34:56,160 --> 03:34:58,279
it and it has been widely

4541
03:34:58,279 --> 03:34:59,880
reported all

4542
03:34:59,880 --> 03:35:03,800
right and it quotes the figure of 9,000

4543
03:35:03,800 --> 03:35:06,200
crores

4544
03:35:06,200 --> 03:35:09,439
now the prime minister of India is not

4545
03:35:09,439 --> 03:35:13,720
going to make a frivolous statement.

4546
03:35:13,920 --> 03:35:17,680
Somebody must have told him number

4547
03:35:17,680 --> 03:35:20,880
but I wonder if there was no keen

4548
03:35:20,880 --> 03:35:23,080
governmental interest in

4549
03:35:23,080 --> 03:35:26,560
me. It's not normal for a prime minister

4550
03:35:26,560 --> 03:35:28,439
of the world's largest

4551
03:35:28,439 --> 03:35:31,680
democracy to be talking about a recovery

4552
03:35:31,680 --> 03:35:35,680
from a guarantor called Vijay Malia. He

4553
03:35:35,680 --> 03:35:38,880
addressed it because your case was very

4554
03:35:38,880 --> 03:35:40,479
public and a lot of people were

4555
03:35:40,479 --> 03:35:42,319
questioning it. You became a public

4556
03:35:42,319 --> 03:35:44,680
matter. You were no more a

4557
03:35:44,680 --> 03:35:48,239
private defaulter. So I'm the only one

4558
03:35:48,239 --> 03:35:51,200
according to you. No, you were too way

4559
03:35:51,200 --> 03:35:53,520
too public than others. There are

4560
03:35:53,520 --> 03:35:56,479
several other companies who have

4561
03:35:56,479 --> 03:36:00,560
borrowed a lot more money. uh I mean a

4562
03:36:00,560 --> 03:36:03,520
lot seriously a lot more money but

4563
03:36:03,520 --> 03:36:06,080
nobody gets mentioned anyway that's fine

4564
03:36:06,080 --> 03:36:08,560
I'm just narrating the sequence of

4565
03:36:08,560 --> 03:36:11,560
events

4566
03:36:12,520 --> 03:36:16,479
then be before we go there

4567
03:36:16,479 --> 03:36:19,239
who are you actually fighting against

4568
03:36:19,239 --> 03:36:23,800
media government or judiciary I'm not in

4569
03:36:23,800 --> 03:36:26,600
uh court against the

4570
03:36:26,600 --> 03:36:29,640
media I'm not in court

4571
03:36:29,640 --> 03:36:33,840
against the judiciary. I can't be I'm

4572
03:36:33,840 --> 03:36:35,239
defending

4573
03:36:35,239 --> 03:36:38,640
myself from those who are prosecuting me

4574
03:36:38,640 --> 03:36:40,960
and the prosecutor is either the

4575
03:36:40,960 --> 03:36:42,520
government or the

4576
03:36:42,520 --> 03:36:45,479
bank.

4577
03:36:45,479 --> 03:36:47,000
Simple.

4578
03:36:47,000 --> 03:36:50,000
Okay, I'll go through the series of

4579
03:36:50,000 --> 03:36:51,920
events. Let's go through those events

4580
03:36:51,920 --> 03:36:54,399
together. One of the sort of allegations

4581
03:36:54,399 --> 03:36:57,160
is that I

4582
03:36:57,160 --> 03:37:00,760
improperly borrowed money from the IDBI

4583
03:37:00,760 --> 03:37:03,000
bank

4584
03:37:03,000 --> 03:37:07,520
by some sort of nexus. Yeah. Between you

4585
03:37:07,520 --> 03:37:10,080
and the general manager and no no the

4586
03:37:10,080 --> 03:37:11,600
chairman and managing director and

4587
03:37:11,600 --> 03:37:14,880
executive directors which is a lot of

4588
03:37:14,880 --> 03:37:16,960
people were involved so that the normal

4589
03:37:16,960 --> 03:37:20,160
rules of lending were not applicable to

4590
03:37:20,160 --> 03:37:23,359
you. IDBI Bank had a Reserve Bank of

4591
03:37:23,359 --> 03:37:26,680
India and a

4592
03:37:26,680 --> 03:37:29,439
um Ministry of Finance representative on

4593
03:37:29,439 --> 03:37:32,560
their board. All the loans that King

4594
03:37:32,560 --> 03:37:35,960
Airlines received were approved by their

4595
03:37:35,960 --> 03:37:40,520
board. Right. M

4596
03:37:41,920 --> 03:37:44,040
that I will draw your

4597
03:37:44,040 --> 03:37:45,880
attention

4598
03:37:45,880 --> 03:37:49,560
to public statement in

4599
03:37:49,560 --> 03:37:54,560
2021 because IDBI is a publicly listed

4600
03:37:54,560 --> 03:37:57,520
entity had to report their financial

4601
03:37:57,520 --> 03:37:59,399
performance to the stock

4602
03:37:59,399 --> 03:38:03,319
exchange and announcing the quarter 1

4603
03:38:03,319 --> 03:38:06,640
results the managing director and CEO MK

4604
03:38:06,640 --> 03:38:09,720
Sharma Um said that

4605
03:38:09,720 --> 03:38:13,560
278 crores by way of

4606
03:38:13,560 --> 03:38:18,920
principle and 331 crores by way of

4607
03:38:18,920 --> 03:38:21,560
interest aggregating

4608
03:38:21,560 --> 03:38:26,479
753 crores was recovered from Kingfisher

4609
03:38:26,479 --> 03:38:28,760
Airlines. This is in

4610
03:38:28,760 --> 03:38:32,880
2021 and therefore IDBI was paid in

4611
03:38:32,880 --> 03:38:35,880
full.

4612
03:38:53,600 --> 03:38:55,920
Then

4613
03:38:57,800 --> 03:39:02,720
why why does CBI and ED find you guilty?

4614
03:39:02,720 --> 03:39:06,960
Because once they file their charge

4615
03:39:08,040 --> 03:39:12,239
sheets, the presumption is that you are

4616
03:39:12,239 --> 03:39:14,439
guilty until you prove yourself

4617
03:39:14,439 --> 03:39:18,520
innocent. Whereas the law requires the

4618
03:39:18,520 --> 03:39:21,680
opposite. You are presumed innocent

4619
03:39:21,680 --> 03:39:26,399
until they prove you guilty.

4620
03:39:26,399 --> 03:39:29,680
I'm still waiting for the CBI and

4621
03:39:29,680 --> 03:39:30,920
enforcement

4622
03:39:30,920 --> 03:39:34,600
directors to produce evidence of my

4623
03:39:34,600 --> 03:39:39,040
guilt, but they continue to pursue me on

4624
03:39:39,040 --> 03:39:41,880
behalf of the banks.

4625
03:39:41,880 --> 03:39:44,520
Now, you see

4626
03:39:44,520 --> 03:39:46,200
here,

4627
03:39:46,200 --> 03:39:50,960
right, the this follows the finance

4628
03:39:50,960 --> 03:39:53,680
minister statement in parliament on the

4629
03:39:53,680 --> 03:39:55,520
floor of parliament.

4630
03:39:55,520 --> 03:39:58,800
on December 17th, 2024, which is a few

4631
03:39:58,800 --> 03:39:59,479
months

4632
03:39:59,479 --> 03:40:02,520
ago. But here is the annual

4633
03:40:02,520 --> 03:40:06,040
report of the Ministry of Finance

4634
03:40:06,040 --> 03:40:10,840
printed hard copy for the year

4635
03:40:10,840 --> 03:40:15,880
2425 in which they say under 4.2.14

4636
03:40:15,880 --> 03:40:18,880
2.14 restitution of properties to

4637
03:40:18,880 --> 03:40:21,399
victims of money

4638
03:40:21,399 --> 03:40:24,200
laundering/ legitimate

4639
03:40:24,200 --> 03:40:27,760
claimments. Okay. And it goes on to say

4640
03:40:27,760 --> 03:40:30,080
the enforcement directorate is not only

4641
03:40:30,080 --> 03:40:33,120
actively pursuing the economic offenders

4642
03:40:33,120 --> 03:40:35,760
to unravel the money laundering but at

4643
03:40:35,760 --> 03:40:38,640
the same time is also making efforts for

4644
03:40:38,640 --> 03:40:42,160
the restitution or return of assets to

4645
03:40:42,160 --> 03:40:44,479
the banks and others who have been

4646
03:40:44,479 --> 03:40:47,000
defrauded by the

4647
03:40:47,000 --> 03:40:50,000
offenders. Right. The ED has

4648
03:40:50,000 --> 03:40:52,800
successfully restored properties valued

4649
03:40:52,800 --> 03:40:55,080
at approximately rupees

4650
03:40:55,080 --> 03:40:59,239
22,280 crores to victims or legitimate

4651
03:40:59,239 --> 03:41:03,160
claimments. The details of the

4652
03:41:03,160 --> 03:41:05,600
restitution/restoration done by ED are

4653
03:41:05,600 --> 03:41:09,160
given below. Number one, Vijay Mallaya

4654
03:41:09,160 --> 03:41:12,399
case quantum of properties restored

4655
03:41:12,399 --> 03:41:14,960
14,131.6

4656
03:41:14,960 --> 03:41:18,399
six crores and in the comment section

4657
03:41:18,399 --> 03:41:19,640
details of

4658
03:41:19,640 --> 03:41:24,479
restoration says complete amount of

4659
03:41:24,479 --> 03:41:27,080
attached properties have been

4660
03:41:27,080 --> 03:41:30,560
successfully restored to the public

4661
03:41:30,560 --> 03:41:34,359
sector banks.

4662
03:41:35,279 --> 03:41:38,560
How did they recover 14,000 cr? What did

4663
03:41:38,560 --> 03:41:41,200
they sell? What did they do?

4664
03:41:41,200 --> 03:41:43,040
They have not given me a statement of

4665
03:41:43,040 --> 03:41:46,000
account. So you don't know what property

4666
03:41:46,000 --> 03:41:48,000
shares have been sold. We talked earlier

4667
03:41:48,000 --> 03:41:50,080
about the properties that were given to

4668
03:41:50,080 --> 03:41:53,399
them, right?

4669
03:41:53,760 --> 03:41:56,319
So everything the give walk me through

4670
03:41:56,319 --> 03:41:59,040
it again if you can please.

4671
03:41:59,040 --> 03:42:00,479
What were the things that how did they

4672
03:42:00,479 --> 03:42:03,600
recover 14,000 all my assets and

4673
03:42:03,600 --> 03:42:05,920
highlight two or three

4674
03:42:05,920 --> 03:42:08,760
shares which got like 14

4675
03:42:08,760 --> 03:42:11,520
properties everything they attached and

4676
03:42:11,520 --> 03:42:14,160
they've sold but in the absence of a

4677
03:42:14,160 --> 03:42:17,279
statement of account can you believe it

4678
03:42:17,279 --> 03:42:19,399
right that from

4679
03:42:19,399 --> 03:42:22,720
2017 the date of the DRT order till

4680
03:42:22,720 --> 03:42:23,960
today

4681
03:42:23,960 --> 03:42:27,040
2025 the banks have not given me a

4682
03:42:27,040 --> 03:42:28,439
statement of

4683
03:42:28,439 --> 03:42:30,279
account how

4684
03:42:30,279 --> 03:42:34,239
much recovery they made on which date,

4685
03:42:34,239 --> 03:42:37,200
how much interest they have charged, how

4686
03:42:37,200 --> 03:42:39,680
the interest gets reduced because of

4687
03:42:39,680 --> 03:42:42,479
recoveries made etc. and what the net

4688
03:42:42,479 --> 03:42:44,600
position is

4689
03:42:44,600 --> 03:42:47,560
nothing reminders to the

4690
03:42:47,560 --> 03:42:52,080
banks from my English lawyers remain

4691
03:42:52,080 --> 03:42:54,000
unanswered.

4692
03:42:54,000 --> 03:42:56,720
letters from me personally to the

4693
03:42:56,720 --> 03:43:01,080
chairman of the SBI remains unanswered

4694
03:43:01,080 --> 03:43:04,880
and my last letter requesting a meeting

4695
03:43:04,880 --> 03:43:07,200
to resolve these issues came back with

4696
03:43:07,200 --> 03:43:09,200
the response saying we are not

4697
03:43:09,200 --> 03:43:11,160
interested in

4698
03:43:11,160 --> 03:43:13,600
meeting. I have had to go to the

4699
03:43:13,600 --> 03:43:15,399
Karnataka High

4700
03:43:15,399 --> 03:43:18,720
Court to request the court to direct the

4701
03:43:18,720 --> 03:43:21,080
banks to give me a statement of

4702
03:43:21,080 --> 03:43:24,000
account. Is this normal?

4703
03:43:24,000 --> 03:43:27,840
Do you think there is another

4704
03:43:27,840 --> 03:43:31,840
um example like this anywhere in the

4705
03:43:31,880 --> 03:43:34,439
world? I mean, it's

4706
03:43:34,439 --> 03:43:37,800
ridiculous. So, if I'm not

4707
03:43:37,800 --> 03:43:40,640
targeted, then why am I being treated

4708
03:43:40,640 --> 03:43:42,520
like this? But

4709
03:43:42,520 --> 03:43:45,199
recovering all the money that you owed

4710
03:43:45,199 --> 03:43:48,279
is not as same as you paying them

4711
03:43:48,279 --> 03:43:50,160
willfully. These are two different

4712
03:43:50,160 --> 03:43:55,520
things. Yes. So maybe you I made four

4713
03:43:55,520 --> 03:43:58,239
different settlement offers from in

4714
03:43:58,239 --> 03:44:02,720
writing from when to when to around 2016

4715
03:44:02,720 --> 03:44:04,920
including before the Supreme Court of

4716
03:44:04,920 --> 03:44:08,479
India which the banks dismissed before

4717
03:44:08,479 --> 03:44:10,560
you left the country you made this. Yes.

4718
03:44:10,560 --> 03:44:11,479
Yes.

4719
03:44:11,479 --> 03:44:14,319
Absolutely. Absolutely. I've been trying

4720
03:44:14,319 --> 03:44:16,160
to settle with the banks. Do you have

4721
03:44:16,160 --> 03:44:19,279
that proof? Yeah. It's public record.

4722
03:44:19,279 --> 03:44:23,239
Supreme Court of India records.

4723
03:44:23,239 --> 03:44:25,840
Absolutely. I would also like to remind

4724
03:44:25,840 --> 03:44:28,399
you I told the finance minister that I

4725
03:44:28,399 --> 03:44:31,600
was leaving in 2016 and March and told

4726
03:44:31,600 --> 03:44:34,960
him that puri please facilitate

4727
03:44:34,960 --> 03:44:36,560
meeting with the banks to settle this

4728
03:44:36,560 --> 03:44:38,720
loan issue. You know here's something

4729
03:44:38,720 --> 03:44:42,439
that don't add up for me. On 29th

4730
03:44:42,439 --> 03:44:44,120
February

4731
03:44:44,120 --> 03:44:48,840
2016, Supreme Court announced

4732
03:44:48,840 --> 03:44:52,479
that the plea seeking action against

4733
03:44:52,479 --> 03:44:56,040
Vijay Malia would be heard on March

4734
03:44:56,040 --> 03:44:59,199
3 and you left on March 2nd. I'm not

4735
03:44:59,199 --> 03:45:02,399
aware of this Supreme Court directive.

4736
03:45:02,399 --> 03:45:05,439
How is it possible? Somebody from inside

4737
03:45:05,439 --> 03:45:07,199
must have told you something because if

4738
03:45:07,199 --> 03:45:09,600
a Supreme Court declares a date against

4739
03:45:09,600 --> 03:45:12,560
you. Mhm. How were you not aware? You

4740
03:45:12,560 --> 03:45:13,680
were already fighting. There were

4741
03:45:13,680 --> 03:45:15,600
lawyers after lawyers. I'm sure there

4742
03:45:15,600 --> 03:45:17,680
must be something because there was no

4743
03:45:17,680 --> 03:45:20,319
such Supreme Court directive. Simple.

4744
03:45:20,319 --> 03:45:23,520
But it's out there in every media

4745
03:45:23,520 --> 03:45:26,000
everywhere. But it's written like if you

4746
03:45:26,000 --> 03:45:28,319
go back if you if you search today all

4747
03:45:28,319 --> 03:45:30,640
the newspapers online everything that

4748
03:45:30,640 --> 03:45:34,640
you see it's said that on 29th February

4749
03:45:34,640 --> 03:45:36,319
Supreme Court directed that and you left

4750
03:45:36,319 --> 03:45:38,479
on March second but my world council

4751
03:45:38,479 --> 03:45:40,239
meeting

4752
03:45:40,239 --> 03:45:41,760
okay

4753
03:45:41,760 --> 03:45:44,160
obligation and appointment was fixed 3

4754
03:45:44,160 --> 03:45:46,640
months before that

4755
03:45:46,640 --> 03:45:49,199
that is okay I'm not saying that so that

4756
03:45:49,199 --> 03:45:52,520
was already a wellestablished travel

4757
03:45:52,520 --> 03:45:56,479
plan I once again remind you I told the

4758
03:45:56,479 --> 03:45:59,600
finance minister himself on the day of

4759
03:45:59,600 --> 03:46:01,840
my departure but that doesn't mean that

4760
03:46:01,840 --> 03:46:04,800
you were not aware of this

4761
03:46:04,800 --> 03:46:07,279
of what I'm I'm sorry I don't get it

4762
03:46:07,279 --> 03:46:09,120
aware of the fact that Supreme Court has

4763
03:46:09,120 --> 03:46:11,120
a hearing against you on March 3rd

4764
03:46:11,120 --> 03:46:13,720
absolutely not there was no such

4765
03:46:13,720 --> 03:46:18,760
hearing there was no such hearing

4766
03:46:20,160 --> 03:46:23,840
Supreme Court has said this all Right.

4767
03:46:23,840 --> 03:46:26,000
So like I have provided you documentary

4768
03:46:26,000 --> 03:46:29,520
evidence. If I'm shown a piece of paper

4769
03:46:29,520 --> 03:46:31,840
that states that there was a Supreme

4770
03:46:31,840 --> 03:46:34,880
Court hearing in my case scheduled on

4771
03:46:34,880 --> 03:46:37,199
the day of my departure, I March 3rd.

4772
03:46:37,199 --> 03:46:41,319
You you left on March 2nd. Yeah.

4773
03:46:41,319 --> 03:46:43,439
So unfortunately I don't have the

4774
03:46:43,439 --> 03:46:44,960
Supreme Court document but I only have

4775
03:46:44,960 --> 03:46:48,239
news and news. I am not aware of any

4776
03:46:48,239 --> 03:46:50,600
such Supreme Court

4777
03:46:50,600 --> 03:46:54,000
directive. I'm not aware of it.

4778
03:46:54,000 --> 03:46:56,319
Okay. Then the other case you said once

4779
03:46:56,319 --> 03:46:59,520
you landed here your passport was

4780
03:46:59,520 --> 03:47:02,520
revoked. Mhm. You wanted to maybe come

4781
03:47:02,520 --> 03:47:05,920
back but you were yourself in shock that

4782
03:47:05,920 --> 03:47:08,800
the passport was revoked. Right. Yes.

4783
03:47:08,800 --> 03:47:10,080
Tell walk me through the day when you

4784
03:47:10,080 --> 03:47:11,439
got to know that you can't come back to

4785
03:47:11,439 --> 03:47:12,800
India.

4786
03:47:12,800 --> 03:47:15,680
I don't remember the exact date but I

4787
03:47:15,680 --> 03:47:17,680
like what were you going through when

4788
03:47:17,680 --> 03:47:19,199
did you get like the moment you got to

4789
03:47:19,199 --> 03:47:21,600
know that your passport been suspended

4790
03:47:21,600 --> 03:47:25,800
or revoked yeah but suspension

4791
03:47:25,800 --> 03:47:28,640
and other forms of restriction would

4792
03:47:28,640 --> 03:47:31,399
have been

4793
03:47:31,399 --> 03:47:34,640
um well understood or perceived

4794
03:47:34,640 --> 03:47:37,000
differently but revocation of a

4795
03:47:37,000 --> 03:47:41,120
passport it's the most severe form of

4796
03:47:41,120 --> 03:47:42,160
withdrawal

4797
03:47:42,160 --> 03:47:46,640
Right. To revoke. Yeah. So because I did

4798
03:47:46,640 --> 03:47:49,520
not attend the summons of the

4799
03:47:49,520 --> 03:47:50,840
enforcement

4800
03:47:50,840 --> 03:47:53,840
directors to which I replied and I said

4801
03:47:53,840 --> 03:47:56,880
I'm coming back but I need some time. I

4802
03:47:56,880 --> 03:47:58,560
need to arrange some money to pay off

4803
03:47:58,560 --> 03:48:01,920
the bank loans etc. Mhm. But they

4804
03:48:01,920 --> 03:48:04,760
revoked the passport.

4805
03:48:04,760 --> 03:48:07,000
what

4806
03:48:07,000 --> 03:48:10,319
they intended to achieve by revocation

4807
03:48:10,319 --> 03:48:15,680
of my passport. I still do not know. But

4808
03:48:15,680 --> 03:48:19,439
so on March 2nd you left. March 8th

4809
03:48:19,439 --> 03:48:22,880
banks informed Supreme Courts that you

4810
03:48:22,880 --> 03:48:25,199
have left the country.

4811
03:48:25,199 --> 03:48:28,800
On 15th April your suspension came for

4812
03:48:28,800 --> 03:48:31,600
your passport. Mhm. revocation the

4813
03:48:31,600 --> 03:48:35,279
suspension was 15th April 2016 and 24th

4814
03:48:35,279 --> 03:48:37,760
April was the revocation you know the

4815
03:48:37,760 --> 03:48:41,120
dates better than me okay fine so from

4816
03:48:41,120 --> 03:48:43,520
15 to 24 MEA says that because there was

4817
03:48:43,520 --> 03:48:46,479
no reply from you they had to revoke it

4818
03:48:46,479 --> 03:48:48,399
why didn't you reply between after 15

4819
03:48:48,399 --> 03:48:49,600
when you got to know that your your

4820
03:48:49,600 --> 03:48:52,960
passport getting suspended

4821
03:48:52,960 --> 03:48:55,520
I replied to them I I don't remember but

4822
03:48:55,520 --> 03:48:57,040
they revoked the passport I mean that's

4823
03:48:57,040 --> 03:49:00,399
what matters because you were not

4824
03:49:00,399 --> 03:49:01,760
replying to them. That's what their

4825
03:49:01,760 --> 03:49:03,840
reply is. That's what they officially

4826
03:49:03,840 --> 03:49:06,160
told you. That's what they have said it

4827
03:49:06,160 --> 03:49:08,960
officially in public. I'm not aware of

4828
03:49:08,960 --> 03:49:10,800
that. I I didn't go talk to them. I'm

4829
03:49:10,800 --> 03:49:12,800
not I'm not I can only talk about what I

4830
03:49:12,800 --> 03:49:14,720
could find online on through newspapers.

4831
03:49:14,720 --> 03:49:16,479
So that's the only thing unfortunately I

4832
03:49:16,479 --> 03:49:18,640
could talk about. Sad thing in my case

4833
03:49:18,640 --> 03:49:21,520
is a lot of people concoct things but

4834
03:49:21,520 --> 03:49:23,680
it's fine. I mean ultimately the bottom

4835
03:49:23,680 --> 03:49:26,160
line is the passport was revoked. Yeah.

4836
03:49:26,160 --> 03:49:30,640
Yeah. So and then and remains revoked.

4837
03:49:30,640 --> 03:49:33,920
So didn't you fight back? What is there

4838
03:49:33,920 --> 03:49:37,120
for me to do to get the password? I have

4839
03:49:37,120 --> 03:49:38,720
to claim my rights under the

4840
03:49:38,720 --> 03:49:40,800
constitution of India that I have a

4841
03:49:40,800 --> 03:49:42,640
constitutional right to a passport etc.

4842
03:49:42,640 --> 03:49:44,720
Yeah. So fight like everyone else like

4843
03:49:44,720 --> 03:49:46,399
the way you would go back and be like

4844
03:49:46,399 --> 03:49:49,920
this is wrongfully done to me. So let me

4845
03:49:49,920 --> 03:49:53,120
get my passport back. I'll fight it. Uh

4846
03:49:53,120 --> 03:49:54,399
I'll come back to the country. I'll

4847
03:49:54,399 --> 03:49:55,760
abide by the law and I'll fight in the

4848
03:49:55,760 --> 03:49:57,359
courts.

4849
03:49:57,359 --> 03:50:00,080
In your view, how many fronts should

4850
03:50:00,080 --> 03:50:02,800
somebody open

4851
03:50:04,600 --> 03:50:08,479
up? How many battles should you open up

4852
03:50:08,479 --> 03:50:10,439
and engage

4853
03:50:10,439 --> 03:50:13,000
in? Just

4854
03:50:13,000 --> 03:50:15,319
everything

4855
03:50:15,319 --> 03:50:18,840
unlimited. I have enough and more to

4856
03:50:18,840 --> 03:50:22,760
do, right? And I want to focus my legal

4857
03:50:22,760 --> 03:50:25,960
battles. Remember

4858
03:50:25,960 --> 03:50:29,080
they are not only time

4859
03:50:29,080 --> 03:50:31,920
consuming reading volumes of legal

4860
03:50:31,920 --> 03:50:33,560
papers is no

4861
03:50:33,560 --> 03:50:36,880
fun and lawyer lawyer fees are

4862
03:50:36,880 --> 03:50:39,880
expensive.

4863
03:50:40,000 --> 03:50:42,279
So, one at a

4864
03:50:42,279 --> 03:50:45,800
time. But don't you

4865
03:50:45,800 --> 03:50:49,920
think it makes it worse for you because

4866
03:50:49,920 --> 03:50:52,000
you didn't come back to the country?

4867
03:50:52,000 --> 03:50:54,960
They tag you as fugitive, fraud, and all

4868
03:50:54,960 --> 03:50:57,359
of these are tags because you choose to

4869
03:50:57,359 --> 03:51:00,640
not come back to the country. If I have

4870
03:51:00,640 --> 03:51:03,160
a fair assurance of a fair

4871
03:51:03,160 --> 03:51:08,960
trial and a dignified existence in

4872
03:51:09,160 --> 03:51:12,960
India, you may be right but I don't.

4873
03:51:12,960 --> 03:51:14,239
Would you be willing to return to

4874
03:51:14,239 --> 03:51:16,239
country if you're assured fair time? If

4875
03:51:16,239 --> 03:51:18,560
I am assured, absolutely I will I will

4876
03:51:18,560 --> 03:51:22,319
think about it seriously. But you should

4877
03:51:22,319 --> 03:51:23,880
also be

4878
03:51:23,880 --> 03:51:26,880
aware

4879
03:51:27,399 --> 03:51:30,120
that there are other

4880
03:51:30,120 --> 03:51:34,680
people who the government of India is

4881
03:51:34,680 --> 03:51:37,439
targeting for extradition from the UK

4882
03:51:37,439 --> 03:51:40,239
back to India.

4883
03:51:40,239 --> 03:51:41,800
In whose

4884
03:51:41,800 --> 03:51:43,880
case they have

4885
03:51:43,880 --> 03:51:48,840
got judgment from the high court of

4886
03:51:48,840 --> 03:51:53,359
appeal that Indian detention conditions

4887
03:51:53,359 --> 03:51:55,880
are violative of article 3 of the

4888
03:51:55,880 --> 03:51:59,279
constitution of the ECR I'm sorry and

4889
03:51:59,279 --> 03:52:02,479
therefore they can't be sent back.

4890
03:52:02,479 --> 03:52:03,880
The plea was

4891
03:52:03,880 --> 03:52:06,800
basically the prolonged detention

4892
03:52:06,800 --> 03:52:10,479
without trial for which we all know

4893
03:52:10,479 --> 03:52:12,840
there are numerous

4894
03:52:12,840 --> 03:52:15,520
examples. They just lock you up and

4895
03:52:15,520 --> 03:52:19,680
throw away the key. That's not justice.

4896
03:52:19,680 --> 03:52:22,399
But you were here extradicted as well,

4897
03:52:22,399 --> 03:52:24,560
right? You lost the case. It's all

4898
03:52:24,560 --> 03:52:26,720
right. I mean, I have illegal. They

4899
03:52:26,720 --> 03:52:28,399
arrested you as well and then they left.

4900
03:52:28,399 --> 03:52:30,800
They they granted you bail, right? What

4901
03:52:30,800 --> 03:52:33,359
happened? Normal part of extradition

4902
03:52:33,359 --> 03:52:35,439
normal that's the procedure what

4903
03:52:35,439 --> 03:52:38,640
happened with the extradition I think my

4904
03:52:38,640 --> 03:52:43,359
stay in England is fully legitimate

4905
03:52:43,359 --> 03:52:45,600
but you lost the case in UK high court

4906
03:52:45,600 --> 03:52:48,560
right to the Indian authorities there is

4907
03:52:48,560 --> 03:52:51,120
more than the particular case that you

4908
03:52:51,120 --> 03:52:54,479
are referring to so there are

4909
03:52:54,479 --> 03:52:56,359
proceedings ongoing

4910
03:52:56,359 --> 03:52:58,520
proceedings in this

4911
03:52:58,520 --> 03:53:02,880
country that's one of the legal battles

4912
03:53:02,880 --> 03:53:04,600
I'm

4913
03:53:04,600 --> 03:53:07,520
fighting that I told you about. But if

4914
03:53:07,520 --> 03:53:09,680
you're assured a fair trial, what do you

4915
03:53:09,680 --> 03:53:12,479
think is that assurance? What does it

4916
03:53:12,479 --> 03:53:14,000
look like? What guarantees would you

4917
03:53:14,000 --> 03:53:15,920
need that you would ever think of

4918
03:53:15,920 --> 03:53:18,000
considering? That's something for the

4919
03:53:18,000 --> 03:53:21,359
lawyers to discuss.

4920
03:53:21,359 --> 03:53:24,239
But if you would agree with me, the

4921
03:53:24,239 --> 03:53:27,680
conduct and the track record of the CBI

4922
03:53:27,680 --> 03:53:30,279
and ED in respect of other unfortunate

4923
03:53:30,279 --> 03:53:32,720
people doesn't inspire too much

4924
03:53:32,720 --> 03:53:35,520
confidence, does it?

4925
03:53:35,520 --> 03:53:37,439
I mean, I can rattle off a whole bunch

4926
03:53:37,439 --> 03:53:38,760
of names of

4927
03:53:38,760 --> 03:53:42,000
people, right? See let's talk about I

4928
03:53:42,000 --> 03:53:44,680
also tell you about the fact that in

4929
03:53:44,680 --> 03:53:48,680
India sadly a business

4930
03:53:48,680 --> 03:53:52,720
failure is compared or is is equivalent

4931
03:53:52,720 --> 03:53:55,199
to a fraud. But there are numerous cases

4932
03:53:55,199 --> 03:53:59,359
of Indian businessmen who have defaulted

4933
03:53:59,359 --> 03:54:01,840
on loan and they have still stayed in

4934
03:54:01,840 --> 03:54:03,520
the country and have fought and they

4935
03:54:03,520 --> 03:54:05,680
have not left the country and that's why

4936
03:54:05,680 --> 03:54:07,279
people don't call them ch they look them

4937
03:54:07,279 --> 03:54:09,040
in a bad eye because that's something

4938
03:54:09,040 --> 03:54:11,359
which socially we are conditioned to

4939
03:54:11,359 --> 03:54:14,120
look at in that way but they stayed

4940
03:54:14,120 --> 03:54:17,120
there that's why they've not been called

4941
03:54:17,120 --> 03:54:20,000
fugitives or chore okay and there are

4942
03:54:20,000 --> 03:54:22,319
cases like there's so many cases like

4943
03:54:22,319 --> 03:54:25,520
that fine call me a fugitive for not

4944
03:54:25,520 --> 03:54:28,199
going to India post

4945
03:54:28,199 --> 03:54:32,239
March. I didn't run away. I flew out of

4946
03:54:32,239 --> 03:54:36,640
India on a pre-cheduled visit. Right.

4947
03:54:36,640 --> 03:54:39,399
Fair enough. I did not return

4948
03:54:39,399 --> 03:54:44,120
for reasons that I consider are

4949
03:54:44,120 --> 03:54:48,359
valid. So if you want to call me a

4950
03:54:48,359 --> 03:54:50,960
fugitive, go ahead. But where's the

4951
03:54:50,960 --> 03:54:54,160
chore coming from? Where is the chi?

4952
03:54:54,160 --> 03:54:57,760
Because the agencies in the country,

4953
03:54:57,760 --> 03:55:00,960
CBI, ED, all the courts, the highest

4954
03:55:00,960 --> 03:55:03,720
court, they all have found

4955
03:55:03,720 --> 03:55:06,399
misrepresentation of funds and they have

4956
03:55:06,399 --> 03:55:07,840
cases against you and they've concluded

4957
03:55:07,840 --> 03:55:10,680
their cases by saying that your

4958
03:55:10,680 --> 03:55:14,640
financial transactions were not clean.

4959
03:55:14,640 --> 03:55:16,840
There's no chy

4960
03:55:16,840 --> 03:55:20,160
there. You took loan. your company,

4961
03:55:20,160 --> 03:55:22,479
Kingfisher Airlines, took a loan to

4962
03:55:22,479 --> 03:55:25,840
revive the company, but then you you

4963
03:55:25,840 --> 03:55:28,399
took that money and offshored that money

4964
03:55:28,399 --> 03:55:30,199
into different accounts around the

4965
03:55:30,199 --> 03:55:34,040
world. That's what the case is

4966
03:55:34,040 --> 03:55:38,319
about. If I'm not mistaken, I think CBI

4967
03:55:38,319 --> 03:55:41,680
in 2017, they concluded around 423

4968
03:55:41,680 --> 03:55:44,319
crores were found. Then ED said

4969
03:55:44,319 --> 03:55:46,960
something around 3,000 cr had some

4970
03:55:46,960 --> 03:55:48,880
problem with money laundering. So there

4971
03:55:48,880 --> 03:55:50,960
were these these numbers I can find

4972
03:55:50,960 --> 03:55:53,120
exact numbers and I can quote which I

4973
03:55:53,120 --> 03:55:57,439
found out. No problem. But why like EDS

4974
03:55:57,439 --> 03:55:58,680
said

4975
03:55:58,680 --> 03:56:03,199
3,547 cr was laundered in 2017. CBI

4976
03:56:03,199 --> 03:56:06,880
alleged that 423 cr was from Kingfisher

4977
03:56:06,880 --> 03:56:08,560
Airlines loan was siphoned off for

4978
03:56:08,560 --> 03:56:11,439
unrelated expenses. Can you explain why

4979
03:56:11,439 --> 03:56:13,680
that happened? Why these all these

4980
03:56:13,680 --> 03:56:16,399
agencies are against you and multiple

4981
03:56:16,399 --> 03:56:18,000
courts are against you and forget this

4982
03:56:18,000 --> 03:56:19,520
if you're calling India and everybody is

4983
03:56:19,520 --> 03:56:21,279
a system it's a nexist they all are

4984
03:56:21,279 --> 03:56:23,680
trying to make you a fraud multiple

4985
03:56:23,680 --> 03:56:24,760
international

4986
03:56:24,760 --> 03:56:28,399
courts Swiss Switzerland authorities UK

4987
03:56:28,399 --> 03:56:31,279
high court one of the courts from UK

4988
03:56:31,279 --> 03:56:33,040
they also found you guilty for

4989
03:56:33,040 --> 03:56:34,960
misrepresentation of funds right and

4990
03:56:34,960 --> 03:56:37,600
they've lost cases Swiss not co Swiss

4991
03:56:37,600 --> 03:56:40,000
authorities what what about the Swiss

4992
03:56:40,000 --> 03:56:41,680
authority they've also found that there

4993
03:56:41,680 --> 03:56:43,960
were transactions

4994
03:56:43,960 --> 03:56:46,199
authority have found

4995
03:56:46,199 --> 03:56:49,600
nothing. The Swiss authority froze my

4996
03:56:49,600 --> 03:56:52,880
children's accounts based on a request

4997
03:56:52,880 --> 03:56:55,640
by the government of

4998
03:56:55,640 --> 03:56:58,439
India. They did not adjudicate on

4999
03:56:58,439 --> 03:57:00,960
anything. The government of India wrote

5000
03:57:00,960 --> 03:57:04,000
to all these foreign governments saying

5001
03:57:04,000 --> 03:57:06,800
Vijay Malia and his family's property

5002
03:57:06,800 --> 03:57:10,560
should be frozen. Right? Only the Swiss

5003
03:57:10,560 --> 03:57:12,160
acted on it.

5004
03:57:12,160 --> 03:57:15,239
The French acted on it.

5005
03:57:15,239 --> 03:57:19,960
Fine. They were not stolen properties or

5006
03:57:19,960 --> 03:57:23,840
acquired from any money due to uh due

5007
03:57:23,840 --> 03:57:26,479
from Kingfisher Airlines to the banks.

5008
03:57:26,479 --> 03:57:28,960
There is absolutely no evidence. The CBI

5009
03:57:28,960 --> 03:57:32,439
and ED are well known to concoct,

5010
03:57:32,439 --> 03:57:35,000
fabricate and present false

5011
03:57:35,000 --> 03:57:37,840
evidence. That's fine. But they have to

5012
03:57:37,840 --> 03:57:40,960
prove it. As I said, the norm is you are

5013
03:57:40,960 --> 03:57:42,880
guil you are innocent until you are

5014
03:57:42,880 --> 03:57:45,199
proven guilty, not the other way around.

5015
03:57:45,199 --> 03:57:49,000
Now, let me explain the 423

5016
03:57:49,000 --> 03:57:53,160
crores. In an airline, more than

5017
03:57:53,160 --> 03:57:56,680
50% of operating costs are in foreign

5018
03:57:56,680 --> 03:58:00,040
currency. You lease planes, you pay in

5019
03:58:00,040 --> 03:58:02,560
dollars. Okay? You import spares, you

5020
03:58:02,560 --> 03:58:04,479
pay in dollars.

5021
03:58:04,479 --> 03:58:07,199
You have aircraft checks and services

5022
03:58:07,199 --> 03:58:09,000
you pay in

5023
03:58:09,000 --> 03:58:10,520
dollars,

5024
03:58:10,520 --> 03:58:13,319
right? So the money has to go out of

5025
03:58:13,319 --> 03:58:18,239
India. You can concoct whatever you want

5026
03:58:18,239 --> 03:58:20,319
and say that money sent out of India

5027
03:58:20,319 --> 03:58:22,640
means siphoning money. But why are they

5028
03:58:22,640 --> 03:58:25,439
calling unrelated expenses? If all of

5029
03:58:25,439 --> 03:58:26,800
these were the expenses for these

5030
03:58:26,800 --> 03:58:28,720
reasons, they would be related expenses.

5031
03:58:28,720 --> 03:58:32,520
But that is a question that the CBI must

5032
03:58:32,520 --> 03:58:35,359
answer. The allegations are against me.

5033
03:58:35,359 --> 03:58:37,160
I am refuting those

5034
03:58:37,160 --> 03:58:39,279
allegations. I am saying all these

5035
03:58:39,279 --> 03:58:41,520
allegations are complete nonsense. And

5036
03:58:41,520 --> 03:58:44,600
how would you explain 3,547 crores which

5037
03:58:44,600 --> 03:58:48,439
ED has alleged that's not sent out of

5038
03:58:48,439 --> 03:58:51,120
India. That is the borrowing from the

5039
03:58:51,120 --> 03:58:53,279
banks.

5040
03:58:53,279 --> 03:58:56,160
But they claim it has been laundered.

5041
03:58:56,160 --> 03:58:58,479
What is launder? If if I laundered it

5042
03:58:58,479 --> 03:59:00,760
means what are you suggesting? I stole

5043
03:59:00,760 --> 03:59:04,399
it. What is laundered? Laundered to me

5044
03:59:04,399 --> 03:59:08,080
is trying to turn cash to check and

5045
03:59:08,080 --> 03:59:11,319
check to cash. That's laundering.

5046
03:59:11,319 --> 03:59:14,000
Right? If they say I've laundered the

5047
03:59:14,000 --> 03:59:16,800
money, what are they saying I did with

5048
03:59:16,800 --> 03:59:19,080
that money? Did I steal

5049
03:59:19,080 --> 03:59:25,120
it? Did I fund my lifestyle with it?

5050
03:59:25,120 --> 03:59:27,439
What is the essence? What is the charge

5051
03:59:27,439 --> 03:59:30,399
of laundering? Here's the basic case.

5052
03:59:30,399 --> 03:59:34,479
Let me try to explain you what a common

5053
03:59:34,479 --> 03:59:37,199
man in India understands about your case

5054
03:59:37,199 --> 03:59:38,680
in very basics

5055
03:59:38,680 --> 03:59:41,479
language. If I borrow 100 rupees from a

5056
03:59:41,479 --> 03:59:45,520
bank, I use 50 rupees from that money to

5057
03:59:45,520 --> 03:59:49,359
buy a property outside India and I only

5058
03:59:49,359 --> 03:59:52,160
have 50 left and that 50 I spent in my

5059
03:59:52,160 --> 03:59:54,160
business trying to make it work. And

5060
03:59:54,160 --> 03:59:56,479
then when the banks are asking me to get

5061
03:59:56,479 --> 03:59:59,040
the money, I say I don't have any money.

5062
03:59:59,040 --> 04:00:01,120
Mhm. Now banks are not saying that why

5063
04:00:01,120 --> 04:00:03,120
did you burn the 50 rupees in making the

5064
04:00:03,120 --> 04:00:05,680
business work. They are questioning why

5065
04:00:05,680 --> 04:00:08,479
did you transfer this 50 rupees to buy

5066
04:00:08,479 --> 04:00:10,720
something else outside. So that is the

5067
04:00:10,720 --> 04:00:12,800
whole case and in your case numbers are

5068
04:00:12,800 --> 04:00:16,120
outrageous. So where is any iota of

5069
04:00:16,120 --> 04:00:19,279
evidence that I used even one rupee of

5070
04:00:19,279 --> 04:00:21,840
kingfisher airlines funds to acquire

5071
04:00:21,840 --> 04:00:23,000
overseas

5072
04:00:23,000 --> 04:00:25,840
properties? There is no such allegation.

5073
04:00:25,840 --> 04:00:29,279
So what are CBI and ED concluding then

5074
04:00:29,279 --> 04:00:31,279
what they have won cases in India.

5075
04:00:31,279 --> 04:00:32,640
They've concluded certain things and

5076
04:00:32,640 --> 04:00:33,760
that's why they're fighting on some

5077
04:00:33,760 --> 04:00:37,439
grounds. Why would UK courts even

5078
04:00:37,439 --> 04:00:40,439
entertain if there's no proof? Why would

5079
04:00:40,439 --> 04:00:45,199
anybody okay entertain what

5080
04:00:45,199 --> 04:00:47,720
Indian CBI

5081
04:00:47,720 --> 04:00:50,080
authorities action against you or case

5082
04:00:50,080 --> 04:00:53,199
against you if there's no proof? The job

5083
04:00:53,199 --> 04:00:57,840
of the UK court is only to establish and

5084
04:00:57,840 --> 04:01:01,479
determine whether there is a primma facy

5085
04:01:01,479 --> 04:01:04,520
case to be sent to

5086
04:01:04,520 --> 04:01:06,520
trial.

5087
04:01:06,520 --> 04:01:10,160
Right. The UK court has not adjudicated

5088
04:01:10,160 --> 04:01:13,800
and said you are either guilty or

5089
04:01:13,800 --> 04:01:17,040
innocent. The job of a UK extradition

5090
04:01:17,040 --> 04:01:20,399
judge is to say is what CBI is saying

5091
04:01:20,399 --> 04:01:23,279
fine is there a case to be tried in

5092
04:01:23,279 --> 04:01:26,800
front of a judge. That's the limit. They

5093
04:01:26,800 --> 04:01:29,920
have determined that. Now it is for the

5094
04:01:29,920 --> 04:01:33,439
CBI and me to fight it out. Okay. In the

5095
04:01:33,439 --> 04:01:36,160
court they provide their evidence. I

5096
04:01:36,160 --> 04:01:38,560
will provide my evidence. Okay. So

5097
04:01:38,560 --> 04:01:41,439
that's as far as the UK court is

5098
04:01:41,439 --> 04:01:43,680
concerned. Got it. So it has just got

5099
04:01:43,680 --> 04:01:47,120
gone to the trial. So absolutely. Okay.

5100
04:01:47,120 --> 04:01:49,439
What is the allegation?

5101
04:01:49,439 --> 04:01:50,600
I

5102
04:01:50,600 --> 04:01:52,640
misrepresented the Kingfisher

5103
04:01:52,640 --> 04:01:56,000
financials. Yeah. Right. To the IDBI.

5104
04:01:56,000 --> 04:01:58,760
Yeah. I colluded with the senior

5105
04:01:58,760 --> 04:02:02,439
management of the IDI to get the

5106
04:02:02,439 --> 04:02:06,720
loan. Right. And then I misuse the

5107
04:02:06,720 --> 04:02:10,199
proceeds of that 900 cr

5108
04:02:10,199 --> 04:02:13,880
loan. That is the three

5109
04:02:13,880 --> 04:02:15,960
allegations. The

5110
04:02:15,960 --> 04:02:19,359
allegation sub allegation about Formula

5111
04:02:19,359 --> 04:02:21,399
1 team

5112
04:02:21,399 --> 04:02:24,800
sponsorship. I responded to you earlier.

5113
04:02:24,800 --> 04:02:27,239
The Formula 1 team sent

5114
04:02:27,239 --> 04:02:31,040
back 10 million pounds to King Fisher

5115
04:02:31,040 --> 04:02:34,800
Airlines to help it. All

5116
04:02:35,160 --> 04:02:38,720
right. They brought in Royal Challengers

5117
04:02:38,720 --> 04:02:41,800
Bangalore as a cricket team. That was a

5118
04:02:41,800 --> 04:02:43,560
sponsorship

5119
04:02:43,560 --> 04:02:45,160
money

5120
04:02:45,160 --> 04:02:48,680
paid right for the umpire's

5121
04:02:48,680 --> 04:02:51,600
uniform where it said Fly King Fisher.

5122
04:02:51,600 --> 04:02:54,760
It was a pure for advertising. Of

5123
04:02:54,760 --> 04:02:58,680
course, the CBI says it was misuse of

5124
04:02:58,680 --> 04:03:01,359
funds. Fair enough. Everybody's entitled

5125
04:03:01,359 --> 04:03:04,239
to their opinion. But when the case is

5126
04:03:04,239 --> 04:03:06,880
tried before a judge, it is the judge

5127
04:03:06,880 --> 04:03:10,000
who will decide who is right, who wrong,

5128
04:03:10,000 --> 04:03:12,399
whether this tantamounts to siphoning or

5129
04:03:12,399 --> 04:03:15,080
diversion or improper

5130
04:03:15,080 --> 04:03:18,760
use in terms of the

5131
04:03:18,760 --> 04:03:22,000
collusion, right? There is not an iota

5132
04:03:22,000 --> 04:03:26,800
of proof. Not an iota of proof.

5133
04:03:26,800 --> 04:03:30,680
I met chairman Agarwal

5134
04:03:30,680 --> 04:03:33,920
twice and in two meetings along with

5135
04:03:33,920 --> 04:03:37,359
four other executive directors of IDBI

5136
04:03:37,359 --> 04:03:39,399
bank. Is it at all

5137
04:03:39,399 --> 04:03:42,160
conceivable that I would be able to make

5138
04:03:42,160 --> 04:03:44,880
some sort of corrupt backhanded

5139
04:03:44,880 --> 04:03:48,279
arrangement with them? Absolutely not.

5140
04:03:48,279 --> 04:03:51,520
But the loan was subsequently approved

5141
04:03:51,520 --> 04:03:54,720
by the IDBI board.

5142
04:03:54,720 --> 04:03:56,640
if there was something so blatantly

5143
04:03:56,640 --> 04:03:59,520
wrong in the sanction process because

5144
04:03:59,520 --> 04:04:01,680
King Fisher didn't meet the norms,

5145
04:04:01,680 --> 04:04:03,279
right? Kingfisher's financials were

5146
04:04:03,279 --> 04:04:07,120
weak. Yes, I agree. But the the board of

5147
04:04:07,120 --> 04:04:09,359
the IDBI bank would have would have

5148
04:04:09,359 --> 04:04:10,880
found out and commented upon it

5149
04:04:10,880 --> 04:04:13,520
themselves. They approved it

5150
04:04:13,520 --> 04:04:16,560
because the CB so the CBI are making

5151
04:04:16,560 --> 04:04:19,840
allegations all of which are fine. But

5152
04:04:19,840 --> 04:04:22,319
there is an equally robust defense

5153
04:04:22,319 --> 04:04:24,720
against these allegations. In the same

5154
04:04:24,720 --> 04:04:28,239
case when it comes to IDBI and all the

5155
04:04:28,239 --> 04:04:30,239
or the consortium of banks which gave

5156
04:04:30,239 --> 04:04:32,479
you loan

5157
04:04:32,479 --> 04:04:34,479
it is also said that there was an

5158
04:04:34,479 --> 04:04:38,600
independent agency from UK

5159
04:04:38,600 --> 04:04:41,920
which put out a brand valuation of 4,100

5160
04:04:41,920 --> 04:04:45,000
crores. Mhm. on Kingfisher's

5161
04:04:45,000 --> 04:04:48,160
brand but in reality the brand value was

5162
04:04:48,160 --> 04:04:50,800
only 160 crores when later was audited

5163
04:04:50,800 --> 04:04:53,600
by an independent valuer and that was

5164
04:04:53,600 --> 04:04:56,239
the mismanagement and that was the

5165
04:04:56,239 --> 04:04:57,720
collusion

5166
04:04:57,720 --> 04:05:01,640
between you and the IDPI board and

5167
04:05:01,640 --> 04:05:04,160
stuff that you sold them and you

5168
04:05:04,160 --> 04:05:07,439
misrepresented the brand value which in

5169
04:05:07,439 --> 04:05:10,080
reality was not the case.

5170
04:05:10,080 --> 04:05:12,960
Okay. So let me tell you there was no UK

5171
04:05:12,960 --> 04:05:16,120
independent agency. Grand thon Grand

5172
04:05:16,120 --> 04:05:20,239
Thornton is a very very wellestablished

5173
04:05:20,239 --> 04:05:23,399
accounting company hired by

5174
04:05:23,399 --> 04:05:27,199
me not by anybody else and the other

5175
04:05:27,199 --> 04:05:29,800
company was brand

5176
04:05:29,800 --> 04:05:32,560
finance. Both these companies gave a

5177
04:05:32,560 --> 04:05:33,880
brand

5178
04:05:33,880 --> 04:05:37,600
valuation right. I submitted the Grand

5179
04:05:37,600 --> 04:05:40,600
Thon brand valuation

5180
04:05:40,600 --> 04:05:42,840
report.

5181
04:05:42,840 --> 04:05:46,800
Right. The bank took

5182
04:05:49,319 --> 04:05:51,479
it. I had

5183
04:05:51,479 --> 04:05:54,040
two recognized

5184
04:05:54,040 --> 04:05:56,439
valuers submitted

5185
04:05:56,439 --> 04:06:00,359
one report which they accepted.

5186
04:06:00,359 --> 04:06:05,520
Now is that fraud on my part? If they

5187
04:06:05,520 --> 04:06:07,520
didn't want it, they said, "This is not

5188
04:06:07,520 --> 04:06:10,000
worth the paper it's written on, tear it

5189
04:06:10,000 --> 04:06:13,439
up and throw it away." I would have done

5190
04:06:14,520 --> 04:06:17,760
so. It's all very well in hindsight to

5191
04:06:17,760 --> 04:06:20,800
construct a case with all sorts of

5192
04:06:20,800 --> 04:06:22,520
frivolous

5193
04:06:22,520 --> 04:06:24,359
allegations

5194
04:06:24,359 --> 04:06:29,279
and if it's got to be in a court of law,

5195
04:06:29,279 --> 04:06:32,319
thrashed out, it will be. But how is

5196
04:06:32,319 --> 04:06:34,199
Supreme Court favoring all of these

5197
04:06:34,199 --> 04:06:36,720
then? Because none of my cases in the

5198
04:06:36,720 --> 04:06:38,960
Supreme Court. Supreme Court ordered you

5199
04:06:38,960 --> 04:06:42,399
to disclose all your assets on 21st

5200
04:06:42,399 --> 04:06:46,160
April 2016. Right. July. And they also

5201
04:06:46,160 --> 04:06:47,960
asked you

5202
04:06:47,960 --> 04:06:52,080
to pay bank a substantial amount to show

5203
04:06:52,080 --> 04:06:54,000
your commitment that you're ready to pay

5204
04:06:54,000 --> 04:06:55,600
everything because you kept saying that

5205
04:06:55,600 --> 04:06:57,520
you were ready to pay. Mhm. Right. Did

5206
04:06:57,520 --> 04:06:59,520
you do that? I made all the disclosures

5207
04:06:59,520 --> 04:07:02,239
under oath on behalf of myself and my

5208
04:07:02,239 --> 04:07:05,600
entire family including my

5209
04:07:06,040 --> 04:07:08,800
children. Now what's the case now? Where

5210
04:07:08,800 --> 04:07:12,000
is this heading in your words? Explain

5211
04:07:12,000 --> 04:07:13,439
me. Okay, forget all of these things.

5212
04:07:13,439 --> 04:07:15,920
We'll come back to what happened on 25th

5213
04:07:15,920 --> 04:07:17,600
February which you are recently which

5214
04:07:17,600 --> 04:07:19,840
recently you did filing a petition to

5215
04:07:19,840 --> 04:07:22,000
Karnataka court. Yeah. So let them gives

5216
04:07:22,000 --> 04:07:23,920
the statement of account. Yeah. So we

5217
04:07:23,920 --> 04:07:26,760
will come to the least. But in your

5218
04:07:26,760 --> 04:07:30,479
words, in simple words, summarize me,

5219
04:07:30,479 --> 04:07:32,640
give me a summary of series of events.

5220
04:07:32,640 --> 04:07:35,560
What exactly happened and why are you in

5221
04:07:35,560 --> 04:07:38,479
trouble? If I could just ask you to do

5222
04:07:38,479 --> 04:07:40,600
it in like next 4 5

5223
04:07:40,600 --> 04:07:43,920
minutes. You left the country. You

5224
04:07:43,920 --> 04:07:46,560
didn't intend to leave the country. You

5225
04:07:46,560 --> 04:07:49,120
were just you just left because there

5226
04:07:49,120 --> 04:07:52,960
was a pres-scheduled meeting. Then after

5227
04:07:52,960 --> 04:07:55,439
a month you get to know that you have

5228
04:07:55,439 --> 04:07:57,560
been suspended. Your passport has been

5229
04:07:57,560 --> 04:08:00,239
suspended. 8 n days later it gets

5230
04:08:00,239 --> 04:08:01,920
revoked and since then you're stuck

5231
04:08:01,920 --> 04:08:05,439
here. Mhm. In middle of it you get the

5232
04:08:05,439 --> 04:08:08,080
extradition process gets started. Two

5233
04:08:08,080 --> 04:08:10,239
times you get arrested but you grant you

5234
04:08:10,239 --> 04:08:11,800
have been granted

5235
04:08:11,800 --> 04:08:16,760
bail. The case gets to trial. Now CBI,

5236
04:08:16,760 --> 04:08:20,080
ED, the government in India, everybody

5237
04:08:20,080 --> 04:08:22,800
finds you guilty people. Nobody found me

5238
04:08:22,800 --> 04:08:24,239
guilty. I mean that's what they they're

5239
04:08:24,239 --> 04:08:25,520
calling it, right? They're giving you

5240
04:08:25,520 --> 04:08:26,960
names. Okay. Everybody has given you a

5241
04:08:26,960 --> 04:08:28,960
tag of let's just not use the word

5242
04:08:28,960 --> 04:08:30,479
guilty.

5243
04:08:30,479 --> 04:08:33,439
CBI hasn't taken place of guilt doesn't

5244
04:08:33,439 --> 04:08:36,760
arise. Yeah. So CBI, ED, multiple

5245
04:08:36,760 --> 04:08:41,120
courts, the government, people of India,

5246
04:08:41,120 --> 04:08:42,800
everybody calls you a fugitive, fraud,

5247
04:08:42,800 --> 04:08:45,920
chore. Mhm. bunch of different things,

5248
04:08:45,920 --> 04:08:48,399
anchors, news, media, everybody calls

5249
04:08:48,399 --> 04:08:52,199
you that, right? And you have been

5250
04:08:52,199 --> 04:08:55,479
publicly publicly on through your

5251
04:08:55,479 --> 04:08:57,840
Twitter on multiple occasions. You have

5252
04:08:57,840 --> 04:08:59,359
been saying that hey, I want to pay the

5253
04:08:59,359 --> 04:09:02,160
money. I want to pay the money. I really

5254
04:09:02,160 --> 04:09:04,399
want banks to listen to me. And you have

5255
04:09:04,399 --> 04:09:05,760
been very clear about it. There have

5256
04:09:05,760 --> 04:09:07,920
been multiple attempts from your side.

5257
04:09:07,920 --> 04:09:10,479
And again and again authorities

5258
04:09:10,479 --> 04:09:11,800
commenting

5259
04:09:11,800 --> 04:09:14,239
that though there has been an attempt

5260
04:09:14,239 --> 04:09:16,920
from your side but the

5261
04:09:16,920 --> 04:09:19,680
effectiveness of it needs to be

5262
04:09:19,680 --> 04:09:22,000
questioned. The seriousness of it needs

5263
04:09:22,000 --> 04:09:23,680
to be questioned. Right? This is what

5264
04:09:23,680 --> 04:09:28,120
the case is. But in all in all in

5265
04:09:28,120 --> 04:09:30,800
summary people call you chore. People

5266
04:09:30,800 --> 04:09:32,439
call you fugitive. People call you

5267
04:09:32,439 --> 04:09:35,680
fraud. Now explain me in summary what is

5268
04:09:35,680 --> 04:09:37,600
your side of story.

5269
04:09:37,600 --> 04:09:38,880
We've gone through the whole thing but I

5270
04:09:38,880 --> 04:09:40,800
want to understand just in short brief

5271
04:09:40,800 --> 04:09:44,399
the way I explained what is what is the

5272
04:09:44,399 --> 04:09:48,120
root cause for all this

5273
04:09:48,120 --> 04:09:51,040
money there is no other criminal

5274
04:09:51,040 --> 04:09:52,880
allegation against me it's all about

5275
04:09:52,880 --> 04:09:55,080
money

5276
04:09:55,080 --> 04:09:58,000
right I showed you the debt recovery

5277
04:09:58,000 --> 04:10:01,560
certificate amount 6203

5278
04:10:01,560 --> 04:10:04,720
crores I've shown you the ministry of

5279
04:10:04,720 --> 04:10:08,279
finance report 14,000 100

5280
04:10:08,279 --> 04:10:11,319
recovered. The question to be determined

5281
04:10:11,319 --> 04:10:15,239
now is has the money been recovered or

5282
04:10:15,239 --> 04:10:17,560
not? Once the

5283
04:10:17,560 --> 04:10:21,080
money has been fully recovered including

5284
04:10:21,080 --> 04:10:22,600
interest,

5285
04:10:22,600 --> 04:10:26,080
right? The root cause is taken care of.

5286
04:10:26,080 --> 04:10:29,199
No, the root cause is intention.

5287
04:10:29,199 --> 04:10:32,880
Sorry, the root cause is intention. Root

5288
04:10:32,880 --> 04:10:34,800
cause is not money and recovery of the

5289
04:10:34,800 --> 04:10:37,439
money. It started like that. The root

5290
04:10:37,439 --> 04:10:39,520
cause of your case is intention. You had

5291
04:10:39,520 --> 04:10:41,520
the money and you still didn't pay. That

5292
04:10:41,520 --> 04:10:43,199
is what we're fighting. That is what

5293
04:10:43,199 --> 04:10:46,800
everybody thinks that you that's why if

5294
04:10:46,800 --> 04:10:50,319
I answer the question, what was the

5295
04:10:50,319 --> 04:10:52,319
share values then and what are they at

5296
04:10:52,319 --> 04:10:54,560
the time of recovery? You'll get your

5297
04:10:54,560 --> 04:10:56,520
answer. The share value went up

5298
04:10:56,520 --> 04:10:58,439
tremendously. Therefore, they could

5299
04:10:58,439 --> 04:11:03,199
recover two and a half times the debt.

5300
04:11:03,199 --> 04:11:06,720
Back in 2016, the values of all the

5301
04:11:06,720 --> 04:11:09,520
securities were barely would cover the

5302
04:11:09,520 --> 04:11:12,199
debt recovery

5303
04:11:12,199 --> 04:11:14,760
certificates. So there was a huge

5304
04:11:14,760 --> 04:11:17,960
appreciation in the value of my shares

5305
04:11:17,960 --> 04:11:23,680
held. So it's fine. The root cause and

5306
04:11:23,680 --> 04:11:28,239
cause or lost to public to the common

5307
04:11:28,239 --> 04:11:31,040
man Indian

5308
04:11:31,080 --> 04:11:35,080
taxpayer is the money which has

5309
04:11:35,080 --> 04:11:38,640
been more than recovered. Right? Fine.

5310
04:11:38,640 --> 04:11:41,640
I'm ready to face trial for

5311
04:11:41,640 --> 04:11:44,880
intention. So if they want to convict me

5312
04:11:44,880 --> 04:11:46,840
for bad

5313
04:11:46,840 --> 04:11:49,840
intention, I'll fight it. Win or lose,

5314
04:11:49,840 --> 04:11:52,720
I'll fight it.

5315
04:11:52,960 --> 04:11:54,520
But you have a problem

5316
04:11:54,520 --> 04:11:56,960
with they calling you chore because

5317
04:11:56,960 --> 04:12:00,359
you've repaid the money. Yeah, I'm

5318
04:12:00,359 --> 04:12:03,520
probably the only chore who is being

5319
04:12:03,520 --> 04:12:05,920
called chore after repaying two and a

5320
04:12:05,920 --> 04:12:08,319
half times. But it's okay. I mean it's

5321
04:12:08,319 --> 04:12:10,560
part of life. You also filed a petition

5322
04:12:10,560 --> 04:12:12,080
in Karnataka High Court, right? What's

5323
04:12:12,080 --> 04:12:14,479
happening there? I don't know. That

5324
04:12:14,479 --> 04:12:18,560
petition as I told you was simply to

5325
04:12:18,560 --> 04:12:20,720
direct the blank banks to provide a

5326
04:12:20,720 --> 04:12:23,199
statement of account which once again I

5327
04:12:23,199 --> 04:12:25,439
find exceptionally strange. I mean this

5328
04:12:25,439 --> 04:12:28,800
probably the only example globally where

5329
04:12:28,800 --> 04:12:31,439
banks do not render a statement of

5330
04:12:31,439 --> 04:12:33,520
account. But if you say that you've

5331
04:12:33,520 --> 04:12:35,760
recovered everything and if bank provide

5332
04:12:35,760 --> 04:12:39,040
you the statement would you be open for

5333
04:12:39,040 --> 04:12:42,560
an independent audit? Of course, anytime

5334
04:12:42,560 --> 04:12:45,760
I'm open for it now on all your

5335
04:12:45,760 --> 04:12:48,399
financial transactions. No problem.

5336
04:12:48,399 --> 04:12:50,439
There's nothing to be hide. Zero.

5337
04:12:50,439 --> 04:12:55,479
Nothing. Please, anybody can help me.

5338
04:12:55,479 --> 04:12:57,720
Nothing.

5339
04:12:57,720 --> 04:13:00,239
Then if according to you the case is

5340
04:13:00,239 --> 04:13:04,399
this clean okay and the authorities are

5341
04:13:04,399 --> 04:13:05,920
questioning it the media is questioning

5342
04:13:05,920 --> 04:13:09,040
it. Do you think you flying out of India

5343
04:13:09,040 --> 04:13:12,720
just made your case worse? Maybe it did

5344
04:13:12,720 --> 04:13:15,399
but I flew out on a pre-arranged

5345
04:13:15,399 --> 04:13:18,239
commitment with no

5346
04:13:18,239 --> 04:13:20,479
uh court directive as you seem to

5347
04:13:20,479 --> 04:13:23,720
suggest that I must be

5348
04:13:23,720 --> 04:13:27,159
there. it. I

5349
04:13:27,159 --> 04:13:31,239
went to Geneva for a

5350
04:13:31,239 --> 04:13:33,319
meeting and

5351
04:13:33,319 --> 04:13:37,560
then you know the media fur that broke

5352
04:13:37,560 --> 04:13:40,120
out and the

5353
04:13:40,120 --> 04:13:42,359
environment was too

5354
04:13:42,359 --> 04:13:48,279
hot and too hostile and certainly not

5355
04:13:48,279 --> 04:13:51,640
conducive for an immediate return.

5356
04:13:51,640 --> 04:13:55,800
Plus, I needed to sell some

5357
04:13:55,800 --> 04:13:58,960
securities to overseas business partners

5358
04:13:58,960 --> 04:14:01,040
in order to generate more money to pay

5359
04:14:01,040 --> 04:14:03,840
these banks, which I've been trying to

5360
04:14:03,840 --> 04:14:08,159
sort of repay since 2016. Maybe not in

5361
04:14:08,159 --> 04:14:10,840
the quantum that finally has

5362
04:14:10,840 --> 04:14:12,920
resulted. I

5363
04:14:12,920 --> 04:14:15,199
mean, the banks have got lucky, isn't

5364
04:14:15,199 --> 04:14:18,439
it? Getting 4,100 crores because of the

5365
04:14:18,439 --> 04:14:21,920
appreciation of my shares.

5366
04:14:21,920 --> 04:14:24,920
14,000.

5367
04:14:25,399 --> 04:14:29,120
If I don't want to say I don't want to

5368
04:14:29,120 --> 04:14:30,800
comment on others. I might as well just

5369
04:14:30,800 --> 04:14:33,080
focus on my own

5370
04:14:33,080 --> 04:14:35,680
business. It's not fair. I'm not the

5371
04:14:35,680 --> 04:14:38,000
type of person who comments about other

5372
04:14:38,000 --> 04:14:40,800
people.

5373
04:14:40,800 --> 04:14:42,000
Do you think people would have still

5374
04:14:42,000 --> 04:14:43,840
calling you like people would still call

5375
04:14:43,840 --> 04:14:47,040
you fraud if

5376
04:14:47,040 --> 04:14:49,520
I have done whatever I could do? If you

5377
04:14:49,520 --> 04:14:50,880
would have stayed in India and

5378
04:14:50,880 --> 04:14:53,520
cooperated with banks,

5379
04:14:53,520 --> 04:14:56,600
sir, people would not call you for fine.

5380
04:14:56,600 --> 04:14:59,080
So people are abusing

5381
04:14:59,080 --> 04:15:03,040
me. Maybe we'll continue to abuse me.

5382
04:15:03,040 --> 04:15:05,000
There's nothing I can do about

5383
04:15:05,000 --> 04:15:08,319
it. That's why I kept quiet for 9 years.

5384
04:15:08,319 --> 04:15:10,720
Is there any proof where you requested

5385
04:15:10,720 --> 04:15:13,680
banks that I want to settle way before

5386
04:15:13,680 --> 04:15:15,040
all of this started? Of course, there is

5387
04:15:15,040 --> 04:15:17,760
proof. Can you give me? Sure. It's part

5388
04:15:17,760 --> 04:15:20,640
of Supreme Court record. How do we

5389
04:15:20,640 --> 04:15:23,359
access it? I ask my lawyers to give you

5390
04:15:23,359 --> 04:15:28,439
a copy. No problem at all. Easily done.

5391
04:15:28,560 --> 04:15:31,800
Before 2016.

5392
04:15:31,800 --> 04:15:35,040
Yes. Absolutely.

5393
04:15:35,040 --> 04:15:36,640
How do you want to be remembered? How do

5394
04:15:36,640 --> 04:15:38,960
you want Vijay Malia to be remembered?

5395
04:15:38,960 --> 04:15:41,239
For hopefully

5396
04:15:41,239 --> 04:15:43,760
for the good things that I might have

5397
04:15:43,760 --> 04:15:46,199
done. Certainly not

5398
04:15:46,199 --> 04:15:50,600
for being a jaw.

5399
04:15:53,479 --> 04:15:57,040
Perfect. All right. Okay. Thank you for

5400
04:15:57,040 --> 04:16:00,319
doing this. You're welcome.

5401
04:16:00,319 --> 04:16:03,279
Thank you so much for walking us through

5402
04:16:03,279 --> 04:16:06,479
every little detail of your case, your

5403
04:16:06,479 --> 04:16:08,880
life, and what's going on.

5404
04:16:08,880 --> 04:16:11,399
I just hope

5405
04:16:11,399 --> 04:16:16,080
that whichever party is right wins and

5406
04:16:16,080 --> 04:16:18,960
people see it the way you want to

5407
04:16:18,960 --> 04:16:21,760
deliver it and people see through every

5408
04:16:21,760 --> 04:16:22,680
little

5409
04:16:22,680 --> 04:16:25,239
thing

5410
04:16:25,239 --> 04:16:29,040
which they must have fed in a bad way or

5411
04:16:29,040 --> 04:16:31,199
wrong way. I don't know which side they

5412
04:16:31,199 --> 04:16:33,600
will believe. I don't know which side

5413
04:16:33,600 --> 04:16:36,279
media will believe. I don't know which

5414
04:16:36,279 --> 04:16:39,040
side the authorities will believe in,

5415
04:16:39,040 --> 04:16:41,680
but I hope they do the right thing. So,

5416
04:16:41,680 --> 04:16:43,120
